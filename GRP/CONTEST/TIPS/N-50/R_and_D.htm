Since the stakes are         high, we thought it would be good to give you an idea of         what the judges are looking for, and conversely, what the         judges have often found lacking about R&amp;D reports, and         also give you some useful tips and advice.</P>                  <P>First, it is important to read the rules in the 'Pink         Book' on this event that can be found at         www.nar.org/pinkbook. You must submit three copies of your         R&amp;D report for judging. The rules give a list of         elements that must be included in a report in order to         qualify for the event, such as stating how much it cost to         do your project. You must also submit a separate 250-300         word written summary of the report. You must be prepared to         give an oral presentation before the judges if your project         is in contention for 1st through 4th place.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Getting an idea for a         project</B></FONT></P>                  <P>According to the Pink Book, an R&amp;D project is         supposed to either advance the state of the art of model         rocketry, or use model rocketry as a research tool. Follow         your curiosity. A good project has an idea that shows         creativity and originality, is feasible to execute in a         reasonable amount of time, and (sometimes fortuitously)         leads to a result that is useful, or advances everyone's         understanding.</P>                  <P>Is there something that has been mysterious, that you         have always wanted to understand? Have you wanted to improve         the performance of your rocket? Is there something that has         always annoyed you about your rocket (misfires, the way your         parachute tangles or won't deploy, red barons, not being         able to find it after launch, the difficulties of altitude         tracking, lack of guidance, safety concerns, etc.) for which         you might have a novel solution? Is there something that you         could use model rocketry for (e.g., taking atmospheric         science data, taking aerial photos for a particular use,         developing a science curriculum to teach some aspect of         physics or math or chemistry, etc.)? For examples of what         R&amp;D projects have been done in the past, you can search         the World Wide Web, NARTS publications, yearly NARAM issues         of Sport Rocketry, and ask other rocketeers.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Start early!</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Don't plan on doing your project a few days before NARAM!         The winning R&amp;D projects in the upper divisions often         take months to over a year to complete, with multiple         aspects/parts/approaches. Building your test rockets or         equipments, testing, allowing time for failures and revising         your approach, and getting a statistically significant         amount of quantitative data from experiments and flight         tests (see below) all take time.</P>                  <P>Keep a logbook chronicling your progress, ideas, data,         and observations. It will be useful when it comes time to         write your report.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The written report</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Be sure that everything listed in Pink Book rule 63.5 is         included in your report. Your entry could be disqualified if         it does not contain all of the required elements in some         form. Include an introduction about why you chose this         project and what was your initial (and sometimes evolving)         objective for the project.</P>                  <P>A written summary of your report is also required. This         is not simply a repeat of the introduction, or an         advertisement for the rest of the project-it is a succinct         summary of your objective, a brief statement of the means         you used to meet it (e.g., calculations, flight tests,         engineering tests, or other data gathering), and a statement         of the conclusions and significant results (What did you         learn? Did you meet the objective?). If a reader had time to         read only your summary, what would you want him/her to know         about your project?</P>                  <P>Keep a bibliography and list the sources that you used         for reference. Do go to the library (surprisingly, there is         stuff there that isn't on the web!), look at the web, and         ask other experienced modelers. But make sure your writing         is original-DO NOT cut and paste entire paragraphs from         reference sources on the web or from books unless you have a         purpose for them in the context of the report. Material         taken from a source should appear within quotes in your         report, and a reference to the original source should appear         in your bibliography. Even if you paraphrase material, or         put it in your own words, you need to reference the original         source. Also, stick to the point of your project, and do not         include extensive irrelevant information or descriptions.         You will not earn extra credit for padding out your project         with more pages.</P>                  <P>Periodically during your preparations, you should try to         step back and think carefully about your experimental setup         and think about what else could account for or affect your         results (was Rocket B heavier than rocket A by a little? Did         Rocket B have slightly crooked fins and so not fly as         straight or have more drag?). Include these thoughts in your         report. Even if you don't know how to correct for such         systematic errors, just doing some thoughtful analysis and         itemizing other possible causes for the results will earn         you the esteem of the judges!</P>                  <P>It would also be good after the conclusions in your         report to include a retrospective on what you would do         differently if you could start over, your thoughts on         follow-up work that could be done to improve the project, or         other ideas that this project inspired.</P>                  <P>Please have several other people read your report before         you enter it in the R&amp;D event. Have them make         suggestions for improvements. Find out what things they         thought were confusing or missing. Also, be careful to         eliminate all of the grammar and spelling mistakes (a good         proofreader helps here too!).</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The significance (or lack thereof) of         your results</B></FONT></P>                  <P>One thing that the judges are especially looking for is         that the contestant is not drawing incorrect or unsupported         conclusions from their observations and experimental         results.</P>                  <P>This can arise for two reasons. First, the contestant may         not have enough controls or checks in his/her experimental         process. For example, if you are doing a lot of flight tests         with several different models, you need to check for and         record possible differences between the models. Do they have         the same mass, surface finish, fin area, frontal area, etc.?         Also, follow procedures that help to 'randomize' the effect         of influences that you may not consider or can't control.         For example, if you are comparing the performance of A vs. B         engines using what you think are two identical models, don't         fly all of the A engines in one model, and all of the B         engines in the other model; divide the two types of engines         evenly between the models. Similarly, if you are comparing         two different types of models, don't make all the flights of         model #1 in the cool, clam morning, and then make all the         flights of model #2 in the hot, windy afternoon; mix the         flights together so that external changes affect both groups         equally.</P>                  <P>The second reason people draw unsupported conclusions is         that they don't consider whether any differences in their         results are statistically significant or not. For any         quantitative data it is a must to have some statistical         analysis. Most importantly, you need to have enough trials         of an experiment to get statistically significant results.         One to three trials is much too few to get significant         results; ten to twenty would be much better. At a minimum,         you should calculate the 'mean' (average) and the 'standard         deviation of the mean' (<IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>)         for all sets of experimental data you want to compare. Note         that <IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>         is NOT the standard deviation of the data sample, but the         standard deviation of the mean of the data sample (which is         the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square         root of the number of trials in the sample).</P>                  <P>The short technical report Basic Statistics for R&amp;D         by NASA astronaut and rocketeer Dr. Jay Apt, available from         NARTS (www.nar.org/narts), discusses in detail the         calculation of mean and standard deviation of the mean. This         is an estimate of how far your calculated mean is likely to         differ from the true mean that would be found by doing a         very large number of trials. There is a 68% chance that the         true mean lies in the range &#177;<IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>         on either side of your sample mean; the chance is 95% that         it's in the range &#177;2<IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>.</P>                  <P>If the <IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>         error ranges of two sets of experimental data overlap, then         you cannot claim there is a statistically significant         difference between the two sets. For example, as Dr. Apt         points out, if you have a set of trials of rocket A with an         average altitude 320 &#177; 20 meters, and a set of rocket B         with 310 &#177; 20 meters, you cannot conclude that rocket A         reaches higher altitudes than rocket B! Including more         trials in a data set gives a narrower error range for         <IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>         and can result in you being able to determine a         statistically significant difference that fewer trials will         not reveal.</P>                  <P><B>&nbsp;Figure 1.</B> Rocket data example         spreadsheet</P>                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="RD_Data.gif" WIDTH=271 HEIGHT=314 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P>Rather than duplicate <A HREF="NARTS_ED01.pdf">Dr. Apt's         report </A>by demonstrating how to calculate the mean and         <IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>         for your data, we show you how to do it in an Excel         spreadsheet (see Figure 1). The bottom of the figure shows         what formulas are in the cells of column B (the same         formulas are copied across into column C). The "track lost"         entry in cell C6 is there to show that the formulas ignore         cells that are blank or contain non-numerical data.</P>                  <P>The spreadsheet shows two sets of rocket altitude         measurements and the mean (average) of each set. But is         there a significant difference between the means? Using the         <IMG SRC="sm.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=12 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>         values from row 10, we can see that the error ranges 191.0         &#177; 5.2 and 202.0 &#177; 4.7 do not overlap, so the data         are significantly different (at least to 'one sigma'-one         standard deviation of the mean). The difference in the         results would be more convincing if the data were different         at the 'two sigma' level (95% confidence) but they are not,         since doubling the error ranges causes them to overlap. By         the way: if the we only had the first three flights in each         set, the results are 191.7 &#177; 11.1 and 204.3 &#177; 8.0,         which does not show a clear difference between the two sets         since those ranges overlap.</P>                  <P>The Student's t-test formula in cell B13 is another         statistical test that Excel can perform. The result shown         tells us that there is only a 13% chance that the two data         sets come from the same population, another indication that         the data are significantly different.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Oral Presentation</B></FONT></P>                  <P>In addition to the written report, the contestants that         are in line to place must do an oral presentation in front         of three NARAM R&amp;D judges and a friendly audience of the         interested NARAM attendees, and answer questions following         their talk from the judges and audience. The presentation         can significantly affect the judges' opinions, but remember         that you need to do well enough to impress the judges on the         written report to earn the chance to present the oral in the         first place!</P>                  <P>Prepare your oral talk well: Have vugraphs         (transparencies) summarizing your report (proofread them!),         and use large font sizes for the text so people in the back         of the room can see them. If you are using a computer         projector, the same applies-but have transparencies as a         backup. Have some props as well (samples of your rocket,         apparatus, etc.) to show the judges and pass around.         Practice in front of your family and friends two or three         times before coming to NARAM and ask them for their honest         constructive criticism regardless of how much it hurts your         ego!</P>                  <P>The R&amp;D rules state that the oral presentation shall         not exceed 15 minutes in length, but the constraints of time         at NARAM usually lead to the judges to request talks with a         length of 5 or 10 minutes, so you should be prepared for         either length. Contestants that go on past the time limit         may be cut off from necessity without finishing. One         viewgraph per minute is a good rule of thumb. You could have         an additional 5 minutes of material in reserve if it turns         out there is time for a longer format. The judges and         audience will not interrupt you with questions during your         presentation, but there will typically be 5 minutes of         questioning after you have finished your talk. Practice         answering questions from your family and friends.</P>                  <P>The judges may ask you to demonstrate some aspect of your         project on the field on Friday, so be prepared for this if         you think your project might warrant it.</P>                  <P>Good luck-we are hoping to see many outstanding projects         at NARAM!</P>                  <P>&#91;end of Joyce's article&#93;</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="#top">return to top         </A><A NAME=plans></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Some examples of past NAR R&amp;D reports, orother useful information, can be found online at thesesites:</B></FONT><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>R&amp;D reports from NARTS, some as free downloads, some         for sale</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://www.nar.org/NARTS/index.html">http://www.nar.org/NARTS/index.html</A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P ALIGN=left>NAR R&amp;D Database, hosted by the CRASH         section website</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://www.crashonline.org/RnD/">http://www.crashonline.org/RnD/         </A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Jeff Vincent's archive of various R&amp;D reports</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://www.acmenet.net/~jvincent/rocketry.html">http://www.acmenet.net/~jvincent/rocketry.html         </A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>R&amp;D Reports about Model Rockets, from the Apogee         website</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://www.apogeerockets.com/education/R&D_Projects.asp">http://www.apogeerockets.com/education/R&amp;D_Projects.asp         </A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Chedar-1 Library, from Pavel Pinkas &amp; WOOSH</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://glasseyeproductions.org/rockets/index.html">http://glasseyeproductions.org/rockets/index.html</A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Model Rocket R&amp;D Reports, from Peter Alway's site</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/petealway/R-and-D.htm">http://members.aol.com/petealway/R-and-D.htm</A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>John DeMar's Rocketry R&amp;D Reports</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://web.syr.edu/~smdemar/rktreports.htm">http://web.syr.edu/~smdemar/rktreports.htm         </A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Model Rocketry In Science Fairs, by Trip Barber (NAR         website)</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://www.nar.org/pdf/science_fair_rocketry.pdf">http://www.nar.org/pdf/science_fair_rocketry.pdf</A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Model Rocketry R&amp;D Technical Bibliography - 1958-1999         by Trip Barber</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="files/Rocketry_R%26D_Jan2000.pdf">Model Rocketry         R&amp;D Technical Bibliography</A> (pdf file)</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> &nbsp;<A HREF="#top">return to top</A><HR></CENTER><P>&nbsp;Last Updated&nbsp; 5/26/2008</P></BODY></HTML>
