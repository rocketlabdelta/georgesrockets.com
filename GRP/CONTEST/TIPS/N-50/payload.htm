Before July 1979,         the NAR standard payload was a very short (1/2" long by         19.1mm diameter) lead cylinder. This is why earlier payload         designs had short payload sections as they were designed to         loft 1/2" lead payloads. Payload is not flown as often         today, so there are not many published designs for the         longer (sand-containing) payloads. The list of plans is         somewhat limited and some of the old lead payload plans         would need for the payload sections to be lengthened quite a         bit.</P>                  <P>Fortunately, <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/compkits.html">ASP</A>         and <A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/rockets.html">QCR</A>         have contest-quality payload rocket kits available,         <A HREF="#plans">as listed further down this page</A>.</P>                  <P>If the old Apogee B7 motors (13mm diameter) were still         contest certified, the optimal designs for this event would         look much different with the rear half of the models         tapering down to 13mm tubing. As staging 13mm A's is not a         good choice this narrows the practical options to a single         18mm B engine.</P>                  <P>A key to any altitude event is building the model to fly         straight and true. Work towards attaching all of the fins so         they are straight and parallel to the body. This should         translate to a straight boost, with minimal wobbling that         would hurt the altitude. A good finish is important for         altitude models. Don't overdo it though, it helps to keep         the model as light as possible, even though it is carrying a         one ounce payload. As weight goes up, peak altitude goes         down. Try to focus on light weight designs and not build too         heavy.</P>                  <P><B>Sources for 20mm tubes and noses</B> - If you want to         build from a plan, or design from scratch (instead of using         the ASP or QCR kits), here are sources for the body tubes         that slip fit over BT-20 tubes and nose cones to go with         them:</P>                  <UL>            <LI><B>ASP (Aerospace Specialty Products)</B> - <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/components.html">Nose            Cone</A>: #<B>BNC20TT</B> &nbsp;TT - 20 Wood Nose            Cone</LI>                        <LI><B>ASP (Aerospace Specialty Products)</B> - <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/components.html">Tube:</A>            #<B>TT - 20</B> Telescoping Tube (.745" ID, .785" OD, 30"            L, wt 22 gm)</LI>                        <LI><B>BMS </B>(Balsa Machining Service) - <A HREF="http://www.BalsaMachining.com/">Nose            Cone</A>: (order a custom made parabolic nose cone to            order to match the tube diameter)</LI>                        <LI><B>BMS </B>(Balsa Machining Service) - <A HREF="http://www.BalsaMachining.com/catalog.htm#T">Tube</A>:            #<B>T20Q-34</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;.787x.748x.039x34 MPC/Quest            T20 (this tube is a bit thick and heavy)</LI>                        <LI><B>Apogee</B> Components - <A HREF="http://www.ApogeeRockets.com/nose_cones.asp">Nose            Cone</A>: &nbsp;#<B>19091 </B> Wood Nose Cone 19mm, .765"            O.D.</LI>                        <LI><B>Totally Tubular</B> - <A HREF="http://www.totubular.com/">Tube:</A>            #<B>T-20+</B> &nbsp;(slips-over T-20) 0.770 O.D. x 0.744            I.D (thinner &amp; lighter than BMS' tube)</LI>                        <LI><B>Quest </B>- Tube: #<B>T-20</B> &nbsp;This tube is            not sold separately from their kits, and it is hard to            suggest buying a kit just to cannibalize.

This produces a small "cloud" at ejection which the                  tracking crew looks for. Without tracking powder,                  it is not likely your model will get tracked.</P>                                    <P>Dry Tempera paint, or a fine powdered                  Fluorescent Dye, are often used for tracking                  powder.Some contestants used to rely on powdered                  chalk, but it is clumpy and does not really produce                  much of a tracking cloud for the volume/weight of                  the powder. Red is a good color choice for tracking                  powder, though some like to use black if there is a                  high overcast or hazy "white" sky. Fellow                  competitors are often willing to share tracking                  powder.</P>                                    <P>Here's a good way to install tracking powder.                  After installing wadding, pack the parachute and                  shock cord into the model, and push them down into                  the tube to leave room for the tracking powder in                  the upper part of the tube. Use a piece of wadding                  or plain paper to make up a long narrow "cup" than                  will easily slide inside the body tube. Press that                  cup into the tube, then pour in the tracking powder                  to fill the cup. About 1" or so depth of powder is                  a good ballpark. Using tracking powder can require                  greater forces to expel everything out of the body,                  which sometimes results in the engine kicking out                  instead (however, the cup method reduces this                  problem a bit compared to just dumping powder into                  the tube). Make sure the engine is secured in the                  rocket extra-tight. Some people like to attach the                  fins a bit above the bottom of the body tube so                  they can apply a "collar" wrap of tape to the                  bottom of the tube and the engine. This helps                  prevent the engine from ejecting.</P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="pics4/powder_DSCN0968.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics4/powder_DSCN0968-tb.jpg" WIDTH=152 HEIGHT=172 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1"><I>click on thumbnail</I></FONT>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0>                     <TR>                        <TD>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                        <TD WIDTH=160>                           <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Above: Example of a                           tracking powder cloud, having ejected from                           a model that was stuck in its                           launcher.</FONT></P>                        </TD>                        <TD>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                  </TABLE>                   </FONT></P></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=320>                  <P><B>Engine</B> recommendations for                  <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C</B></FONT> Payload                  Altitude:</P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C6-3 </B></FONT>(abnormally                  heavy or draggy model, like an Alpha with payload                  section added)</P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD ALIGN=right WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=10>                  <P>or</P>               </TD>               <TD HEIGHT=10>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C6-5</B></FONT><B>                  </B>(typical contest payload models)</P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD ALIGN=right WIDTH=320>                  <P>or</P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C6-7</B></FONT><B> </B>(low                  drag light contest payload models, pistoned                  models)</P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=320>                  <P></P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          <A HREF="#top">return to top         </A><A NAME=plans></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Model Plans &amp; Kits</B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>Designer</B></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>Notes</B></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P ALIGN=left><A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/store/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=546&Category=176">ASP         - "Versi - Loader 18"</A> payload rocket kit<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#KVL -         18</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/compkits.html">ASP         (Aerospace Specialty Products)</A>, Andy Jackson</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Good competitive kit for 18mm engines.<BR>         <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/versiloaderimage.html">More         info</A> on the Versi-Loader 18 kit.</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/rockets.html">QCR -         No-Part II kit</A> - Payload A, B, or C</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/rockets.html">QCR -         Qualified Competition Rockets</A>, Ken Brown</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Good competitive kit for 18mm engines</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://nar.org/competition/plans/pdf/awnxxii.pdf">AWN-22         C Payloader</A> plan (from NAR website)</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Plan by Dave Cook</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>This record-setting FAI model from 1980 used the old         phased-out 1/2" tall lead payload.
