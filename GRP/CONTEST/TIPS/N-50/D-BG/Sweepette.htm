Functionally         though, the 18" and 19" Sweepette are both fine for D B/G.         </P>                  <P>I do not have a Campbell kit to give you any detailed         conversion info. Basically, if you've been thinking aobut         converting an HLG, I can at least recommend the Sweepete as         a proven model.</P>                  <P>I recently came across an old Sweepette-18 I'd scratch         built, from the late 1970's when Tony Williams and I flew as         the Maddog Fatcat Team. It is shown at right, minus the         lower rudder. The wing was covered with Japanese tissue.         Aluminum foil was added to the center 2" to protect against         exhaust damage. These days, I'd recommend adhesive aluminum         tape, sometimes sold as Muffler Tape, or as metal duct         tape.</P>                  <P>For the rudder, make a new one that is a larger than the         original, say about 30% larger. That will help make sure         that the side area of the pop-pod is accounted for. Glue the         rudder to the BOTTOM of the fuselage, not the top.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=280>         <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_1838.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_1838-tb.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=213 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#CC0000">Click for larger         image</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="60%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=280>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="60%">         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>For your model, use your favorite pop-pod attachment         method. For this old model, I used what could be considered         to the the old Manta type attachment method, but reversed,         where the part with the side plates is on the glider instead         of the pod.</P>                  <P>In the photo at right, the Drop-Weight Dethermalizer is         shown. It was made from 1/32" plywood. A small cord runs to         the tail, so when the DT falls off, it swings to the tail         and destabilizes it, so it sort of tumbles down. Elastic         thread was used to hold the DT in place unti lthe SIG DT         fuse burned thru the thread.</P>                  <P>The pop-pod was BT-50, and the model flew on a D12-3.         This model also would probably be suitable to fly on a D10.         I would not recommend a D13. </P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=280>         <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_1842.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_1842-tb.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=136 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=top></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#CC0000">Click for larger         image</FONT>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="60%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=280>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><A HREF="../boost_glide.htm">Back to D B/G TipsPage</A></P></CENTER><P></P></BODY></HTML>
