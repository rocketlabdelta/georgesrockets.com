For this         event, the <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/gcgassaway/Rotaroc_18mm.gif">Rotaroc-         18mm Plan</A>. There have been variations by others, such as         the QCR <A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/helos.html">High         Rotor kits</A>, and the Apogee <A HREF="http://www.ApogeeRockets.com/Heli_Roc_Kit.asp">Heli-Roc         kit</A>. The basic design is a straight body tube with         simple blades folded flat to the tube on boost, the folded         blades in a triangular cross-section. The design is not too         hard to build, though some people dislike attaching the         hinges. It's a reliable competitive design that usually puts         in solid flights.</P>                  <P><B>Rose-A-Roc</B> - Designed by Art Rose. There have been         variations designed by others, such as the <A HREF="http://nar.org/competition/plans/pdf/whirl.pdf">Whirl-A-While</A>         by John DeMar, and the <A HREF="http://www.glasseyeproductions.org/rockets/chichop/chichop.html">Chicago         Chopper</A> by Pavel Pinkas, but those are 13mm A sized         plans. The basic design is to make the model as small in         cross-section as possible. So the blades split lengthwise,         so the chord is half of normal, then folds rearwards to be         parallel to the body. Rather than a body tube, most of the         body is replaced by graphite tubing or a wood dowel, to give         the rotor blades clearance for their lengthwise folds and to         have a smaller cross section (frontal view). These models         boost higher than Rotaroc type models. In the hands of a         good builder, they can out-perform Rotarocs. They are harder         to build than Rotaroc types.</P>                  <P>There is now a <A HREF="http://fliskits.com/products/rocketkits/kit_detail/rosearoc.htm">Rose-A-Roc         KIT </A>by FlisKits! Sized for 18mm engines. There will         probably be a lot of these kits competing at NARAM.</P>                  <P><B>Internal blade</B> - There is another design which can         be very competitive, which involves storing the blades         inside of the body tube. To do this effectively, the model         needs to have a diameter large enough to hold reasonable         sized blades, without the body weighing too much. In any         case, the models are quite difficult, high payoff if they         work but at a higher risk than more conventional models. So,         this is not really recommended for newer competitors to         try.</P>                  <P>Here is a pdf file of theR&amp;D project that Pavel         Pinkas of the Chddar-1++ Team wrote about <A HREF="http://glasseyeproductions.org/rockets/hd/rd.pdf">Design         of a Competitive Heliroc</A>. The design was an internal         bladed model.</P>                  <P><B>Qualified flights</B> - OK, sometimes performance does         not matter. For various reasons, whether for return or         flight points, people just want to fly something that will         qualify as a helicopter flight. A sport design that some use         is the "<A HREF="http://nar.org/competition/plans/pdf/Taz.pdf">Tasmanian         Devil</A>" (This is an A sized plan, needs to be scaled up         for B power). It could be described as a pre-deployed         helicopter, with small blades permanently glued in the open         position. It spins up very quickly on launch, causing a lot         of drag, making it boost low like a flying saucer type         model, and flying for only a few seconds. For that matter, a         flying saucer type of model, with properly added spin tabs,         can make for a qualified flight helicopter model (like a         scaled-down Tri-F-O)                  <HR>                  </P>                  <P><B>Deployment magic</B> - The Rotaroc and Rose-a-roc type         designs use the ejection charge only as a starting point to         cause the design to go from rocket boost mode to deploy for         helicopter descent. Rubber bands are used to make the blades         deploy. What keeps them from moving until ejection? Usually         a burn-thread which is rigged to hold the model n boost         mode. At ejection, the thread burns, allowing the rubber         bands to do their thing.</P>                  <P>The burn thread needs to be thin. The button and carpet         type of thread that Estes uses for shroud lines is too thick         for anything short of a D12 ejection charge to burn. So use         a finer thread. I prefer to use white elastic thread. The         Rotaroc plans show how to run the thread to hold the         blades.</P>                  <P>Some designs do not use burn-thread. Such as Pavel         Pinkas' Chicago Chopper, and internal bladed designs, where         the ejection causes a mechanical action that frees the         blades to deploy.</P>                  <P>The rubber bands need to be selected carefully. Do not         just grab any rubber band and try to force it to stretch         really far, as the blades may bow outwards a lot when         prepped for boost, or the hinges may be ripped off from too         much force at deployment. Look for rubber bands with 1/16"         cross sections, in various lengths , at Office Supply type         stores. Look for the classic pale brown latex bands, colored         bands tend to not stretch as much. While the band should not         be stretched so much that it causes excessive force, it         should not be relaxed at the end of travel so that there is         slack, as the blades might not deploy fully. This is not         hard to get right, just it can cause trouble if it's         overlooked.                  <HR>                  </P>                  <P><B>Building Helicopter models</B> - The two most critical         parts of most helicopter models are the rotor blades, and         the hinges that connect the blades to the main body.</P>                  <P>I always liked using Klett hinges, because they had hinge         pins that could be easily removed for assembly.         Unfortunately, Klett stopped making R/C plane hinges some         eyars ago. The most suitable non-Klett replacements are the         small hinges made by Du-Bro. However for models like         Rotarocs, it is still very useful to be able to remove the         hinge pins for some assembly steps, and the Du-Bro hinge         pins are not meant to be removed. The hinge pins can be         modified though, either using vice-grips to un-crimp the         crimped end, or using a Dremel tool with cut-off wheel to         remove the flattened crimped end of the hinge pin.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=400>                  <P>Attaching the hinges to the body tube is often                  the hardest part for some people to do.                  Fortunately, it is possible to make jigs that                  greatly assist in attaching the hinges, and                  attaching them at the same angle every time. Click                  on the thumbnail at right to see how you can make a                  single hinge jig, or better yet a triple hinge jig                  that allows all three hinges to be attached at the                  same time. The jig requires the use of Klett type                  hinges which have removable hinge pins.</P>                                    <P>The 4 degree hinge skew angle shown is suitable                  for most helicopter models, unless the plans                  specify different.</P>                                    <P><B>Rotor Blades</B> - Take note of which                  direction that the model will be rotating, so that                  you build the rotor blades to rotate the same                  way!</P>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="49%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Pics2/Hinge_Jig.gif"><IMG SRC="Pics2/Hinge_Jig-tb.gif" WIDTH=262 HEIGHT=128 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <P>Rotors are much like making wings for rocket boosted         gliders. Except the rotors are smaller in chord and tend to         be more fragile.</P>                  <P>The instructions that Pavel Pinkas wrote for the         <A HREF="http://www.glasseyeproductions.org/rockets/chichop/chichop.html">Chicago         Chopper</A> has good info on making rotor blades. It is an         "A" sized model, but the info on making blades is useful         regardless of size.</P>                  <P>Weight is a an important issue for helicopter models,         regardless of design. The lighter, the better, as long as         the blades (and the rest of the model) are physically strong         enough. Try to find reasonably light balsa for the rotor         blades, but without being so weak that the blades will bow         outwards too easily when the blades are folded for         boost.</P>                  <P>Long narrow blades can be hard to sand to shape, as they         are so relatively fragile. See the Rotaroc-A plans to see         how the trailing edge portions of the blades can be sanded         to rough shape while still attached to 3" wide balsa         sheeting, then after cutting off the first blade the other         trailing edge can be shaped with the resulting 2" wide         sheet. Using that method, the bulk of the difficult shaping         (trailing edge) can be done to the blades before they are         all cut to their final 1" width.</P>                  <P>A VERY nice sanding block, useful for gliders,         helicopter, and any rocket really, is an all-metal 2-piece         clamp-type sanding block made by Red Devil, carried by most         Ace Hardware stores (look near where they stock sandpaper).         It has a 1/8" foam rubber backing sheet, which ought to be         removed since it allows rounding things too easily in 3-D         when you usually want to shape in 2-D at a given time (as         with a wing). So, remove the rubberized portion. That         sanding block holds a 4.5 x 5.5" sheet of sandpaper (quarter         of a 9 x 11" sheet), with a 3.5 x 4.5" sanding surface area         on the block. This works far better in most cases than a         narrow sanding block. Of course, the wings (or fins) should         be shaped and finished before they are glued to the fuselage         or model.</P>                  <P>When doing very rough shaping for rotor blades, 80 to 120         grit sandpaper is good to grind off a lot of wood in a short         time. Don't over-do it though by sanding off too much. Then         go to finer grit like 180 to 220 for finer shaping. Beyond         that, 280/320 paper, is sort of a cross between final         shaping and setting up for a final finish. A final finish         for bare balsa is to use 400 grit paper. Get the "black"         type wet or dry sandpaper, it sands better and lasts longer         than the reddish types. If you use any clear dope, use 320         to 400 grit paper before and after.</P>                  <P>Ed LaCroix's <A HREF="http://plans.rocketshoppe.com/apogee/Maxima/apoMaxima.htm">instructions</A>         for the Maxima-A Boost Glider has some good info on sanding         wings to shape, skills which are applicable to helicopter         blades.</P>                  <P>Kevin Wickart wrote a nice short article on how to do         quick and easy airfoils, on the WOOSH section's website.         <A HREF="http://www.wooshrocketry.org/Tips/Kevin%20Wickart/tips2.htm">Click         here</A> to read it.</P>                  <P><B>Helicopter Model Finish </B>- Never use paint. For         newer fliers, no finish is usually fine, better than         weighting the model down too much and maybe having warpage         problems. If you want to improve the finish on the blades,         use some thinned clear dope in one or two light coats,         sanding before and after with 240 and 400 grit sandpaper.         The idea it not to weigh the model down too much, or add so         much that the wood parts might tend to warp too easily.</P>                  <P><B>Coloring</B> - OK, so bare balsa (even with clear         dope) is not easy to see in the air or on the ground. Use a         large black magic marker to color the bottom of the rotor         blades black, as that shows up against the sky pretty well.         But leave the last 3-4" of the blades uncolored. Color those         last 3-4", both top and bottom, with a large red or orange         magic marker. If you can find true fluorescent markers (not         to be confused with wimpy fluorescent highlighters), an         orange or red/magenta fluorescent color is highly         recommended. The reason for the bright color for the last         3-4" of the blades is that when the helicopter model lands,         it usually falls over on two blades, leaving the other blade         sticking upwards like a "flag". So, colors on the blade tips         can help you find the model</P>                  <P><B>Prepping</B> - it's usually easier to prep for flight         by having the rubber bands unhooked, when setting the blades         or tying the blades for boost. Hooking up the rubber bands         afterwards. As long as you don't forget the hooking up the         bands step before launch!</P>                  <P>To prep helicopter models that use burn threads, it can         be useful to use something to act like a needle threader to         carry the thread thru the two small holes in the body. A         simple tool is to take a 12" long piece of .015" music wire,         and fold it sharply in half. The resulting tool can be         pressed thru the small holes easily, the thread slipped         inside the bent portion, then the thread pulled thru the         holes in the body so the thread is passed to the other         side.</P>                  <P>Don't forget to hook up those rubber bands now....</P>                  <P><B>Flying </B>- Regardless of design, try to fly it in a         manner so it will not weathercock a lot into the wind (angle         a little bit downwind, relative to how windy it is). For         one, that will make the model eject higher up and therefore         get a better time (always a plus). But the other is that the         model might never deploy at all. If the model goes beyond         apogee and is falling towards the ground at a good speed,         the rubber bands might not be able to overcome the high         aerodynamic forces, letting the model plummet to the ground.         This is not too likely for 1/2A, but it is worth         mentioning.</P>                  <P><B>And remember....check the rubber bands!</B> - Many         people, even very experienced fliers, have meant to hook up         the rotor rubber bands at the pad, shortly before launch,         and forgotten to do so. Resulting in crashed flights.</P>                  <P><B>More Information</B> - Check out the "<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/S9Gyrocopterandhelirocs/">S9         Gyrocopter and helirocs</A>" Yahoo group, which discusses         NAR and FAI (S9) Helicopter Duration models.</P>                  <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=20>                  <P><B>Engine </B>recommendation for                  <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B</B></FONT> Helicopter:</P>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top HEIGHT=20>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B6-2 </B></FONT>(Typical                  helicopter models, including Rotaroc types)</P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD ALIGN=right WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=10>                  <P>or</P>               </TD>               <TD HEIGHT=10>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B6-4 </B></FONT>(light and                  low-drag models such as Rose-a-Roc types)</P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=260>                  <P></P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B4-2 </B></FONT>(lower boost                  stress - Typical lighteight helicopter models,                  including Rotaroc types)</P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=260>                  <P ALIGN=right>or</P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B4-4 </B></FONT>(lower boost                  stress - light and low-drag models such as                  Rose-a-Roc types)</P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><A NAME=plans></A><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Model Plans &amp; Kits</B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>Designer</B></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>Notes</B></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/gcgassaway/Rotaroc_18mm.gif">Rotaroc-         18mm</A> plan</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>by George Gassaway</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Competitive reliable helicopter Plan</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://fliskits.com/products/rocketkits/kit_detail/rosearoc.htm">Rose-A-Roc         KIT </A>by FlisKits</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>by Art Rose, sold by <A HREF="http://fliskits.com/products/rocketkits/kit_detail/rosearoc.htm">Fliskits</A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Competitive reliable helicopter Kit</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>QCR - <A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/helos.html">High         Rotor I</A> (Rotaroc) and <A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/helos.html">Ultimate         II</A> (Spinning Hub) Helicopter kits</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/rockets.html">QCR -         Qualified Competition Rockets</A>, by Ken Brown</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>QCR's kits based on Rotarocs and<BR>         Rose-a-rocs</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://nar.org/competition/plans/pdf/Taz.pdf">Tasmanian         Devil</A> sport helicopter plan (NAR website)</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>by George Gassaway</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>An easy to build, low-flying, sport design that is         sometimes used for "Qualified Flights" and sure return         flights.
