Compromises of low drag and low model weight, protectingthe egg (capsule and cushioning), and deploying a chute that is notbig enough for a gentle landing versus too big a chute which can jaminside the tube or let the model drift away unrecovered.</P><P>There are many engine choices available for this event. Thebest-flying will tend to be 18mm composite engines, such as the D10and D21. There is also the D13 reload, though that adds a bit ofextra mass and the cost of the reload casing will hurt if you losethe model. Also, the higher the thrust of the engine, the strongerthe model will need to be to not shred its fins off. A model flyingon a D21 needs to be a lot stronger than one flying on a D10.</P><P>The classic old reliable way to go is to use a D12 engine.</P><P>This event was held at the very same site at NARAM-46 in 2004.Some of the better-flying models drifted off into the wood. It wasnot very windy, simply it was an issue of models flying so high up,and needing to land slowly enough not to break the egg, that it tookthem so long to land that some of the best models drifted into thewoods. So, this may be an issue for 2008 as well.</P><P>A <A HREF="#plans">list of plans and kits</A> is included furtherdown on this page.</P><P><B>General Tips for Eggloft Altitude</B></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="50%">         <P>An egglofter with a long tapered conical shroud is OK for         eggloft altitude. The <A HREF="http://nar.org/competition/plans/pdf/twoMinuteEgg.pdf">Two         Minute Egg</A> plan is such a model, and both <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com">ASP</A>         and <A HREF="http://www.cybertravelog.com/qcr">QCR</A> have         similar contest oriented kits.</P>                  <P>A straight body-tubed model with capsule on top also is         competitive. Such as an all-18mm body, or all 24mm body.         <A HREF="http://www.cybertravelog.com/qcr">QCR</A> has kits         of this type. Custom Rockets' <A HREF="http://www.customrocketcompany.com/store/">Elite         Egglofter kit</A> is a reasonable C eggloft altitude         model.</P>                  <P>Some competitors feel the straight body type flies         higher, while some prefer shrouded bodies. Straight bodies         have simplicity going for them, while shrouded bodies have         reliability in their favor due to the recovery system         storage space and room for tracking powder.</P>                  <P>A straight body tube with a larger diameter, such as 1.3"         to 1.65" diameter (BT-55, 35mm, BT-60) can be used. The         model will be draggier and usually heavier, of course, and         therefore at a competitive disadvantage. The Quest         "<B>Courier</B>" egglofter kit can be used with 18mm         composite D engines or on a D12 if built with a 24mm engine         mount. Some regular models you might already have can be         adapted to fly as an eggloft altitude model by replacing the         nose cone with a capsule. But they cannot be too heavy or         they just will not fly safely enough with the added weight         of an egg.</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="10%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="Pics2/eggalt1.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=144 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>         </B></FONT>Straight tube<BR>         (Prangroc)</CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="10%">         <CENTER><IMG SRC="Pics2/eggdur1.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=144 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>         Conical Shroud<BR>         (2 Minute Egg)</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><B>Build well</B> - A key to any altitude event is building themodel to fly straight and true. Work towards attaching all of thefins so they are straight and parallel to the body. This shouldtranslate to a straight boost, with minimal wobbling that would hurtthe altitude.</P><P>And the faster the model boosts, the more strongly it needs to bebuilt, to avoid shredding the fins at high speed.</P><P><B>Egg Capsule</B> - <A HREF="http://www.pratthobbies.com">PrattHobbies</A> makes an excellent vac-formed egg capsule (the old CMRcapsule). Some companies like <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com">ASP</A>and <A HREF="http://www.cybertravelog.com/qcr">QCR</A> carry thatcapsule. <A HREF="http://www.ApogeeRockets.com">Apogee</A> also hastheir own vac-formed egg capsule.</P><P>Another capsule sometimes used is a plastic Easter Egg, of a sizethat is just a little bigger than an egg. Such capsules use two "longhalves" from two 1.75" diameter Easter eggs, rather than one plasticegg due to the short half with a flange sticking out, as the flangelimits the inside diameter too much. Easter Egg capsules that smallcan be hard for the eggs to fit in and be safely cushioned, however."Grade A Large" eggs tend to vary significantly in diameters, soEaster Egg capsules are somewhat risky. It's best not to risk using atoo-cramped capsule.</P><P><B>Padding</B> - Use foam or some other flexible material to tryto cushion the egg so it will not get cracked. My favorite basiccushioning is to get hold of a foam egg carton and cut out the fourcorner "cups" as they fit the egg pretty well. I add other thin foampadding as well. The egg needs to be padded enough that it can'trattle, but don't pack it so tight that it's under pressure whenloaded in the capsule. If you are using a plastic capsule, don'tbother with putting the egg inside of a plastic bag....if the eggbreaks you can just clean the capsule with water, without anydamage.</P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=550>         <P><B>Parachute</B> - In Eggloft Altitude, the trick is to         balance using a chute size that will not land so hard that         the egg might crack, versus using a bigger chute that may         let the model drift too far off to recover. A ballpark         suggestion for decently padded eggs in a light model is to         use a 12" to 14" parachute. For eggloft Altitude, using a         commercial type chute canopy is usually OK, you don't want         to use a canopy so thin that it rips easily.</P>                  <UL>            <LI>Andy Jackson of ASP (Aerospace Specialty Products)            has written a <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/uploads/files/SelectingParachutesforEgg.doc">great            article</A> on considering what size or type of            parachutes to use in egglofting competition, whether for            duration or altitude. It also has tips on chute            packing.</LI>         </UL>                  <P>Shroud lines can be "button and carpet thread", which is         what most manufacturers use.</P>                  <P>To avoid the lines pulling loose from the parachute under         stress, the shroud lines can be attached to run over the top         of the chute as shown at right. Cut-up band-aid pieces can         make for very sticky yet flexible shroud line tabs.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="ChuteL.gif"><IMG SRC="ChuteS.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=121 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1"><I>click on                  thumbnail</I></FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <B>Shock Cords</B> - It is useful to use a shock cord that canactually absorb the shock of deployment , given the weight involvedwith egglofters. 1/8" elastic works very well for that purpose, butis not ideal to attach directly to the body tube. Many competitorsprefer to use a length of 100 pound grade Kevlar cord to attach tothe body tube (especially for mounting inside), then tie the elasticshock cord to the other end of the Kevlar cord. The 2-Minute Egg planmentions using wire cable in a similar way to link elastic to themodel. This method was used before Kevlar came into use for contestmodels, so 100 pound Kevlar can be used rather than wire cable forthe 2-Minute Egg. Unfortunately, the very hot ejection charge of aD12 can burn a 100 pound kevlar shock cord if it is attached withinthe first 3" or so of the ejection end of the engine, so for D12models the kevlar cord needs to be mounted away from the heat blastor protected from the heat.</P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=550>         <P><B>Tracking Powder</B> - It is highly recommended to use         tracking powder in your model. This produces a small "cloud"         at ejection which the tracking crew looks for. Without         tracking powder, it is not likely your model will get         tracked.</P>                  <P>Dry Tempera paint, or a fine powdered Fluorescent Dye,         are often used for tracking powder.Some contestants used to         rely on powdered chalk, but it is clumpy and does not really         produce much of a tracking cloud for the volume/weight of         the powder. Red is a good color choice for tracking powder,         though some like to use black if there is a high overcast or         hazy "white" sky. Fellow competitors are often willing to         share tracking powder.</P>                  <P>Here's a good way to install tracking powder. After         installing wadding, pack the parachute and shock cord into         the model, and push them down into the tube to leave room         for the tracking powder in the upper part of the tube. Use a         piece of wadding or plain paper to make up a long narrow         "cup" than will easily slide inside the body tube. Press         that cup into the tube, then pour in the tracking powder to         fill the cup. About 1" or so depth of powder is a good         ballpark. Using tracking powder can require greater forces         to expel everything out of the body, which sometimes results         in the engine kicking out instead (however, the cup method         reduces this problem a bit compared to just dumping powder         into the tube). Make sure the engine is secured in the         rocket extra-tight. Some people like to attach the fins a         bit above the bottom of the body tube so they can apply a         "collar" wrap of tape to the bottom of the tube and the         engine. This helps prevent the engine from ejecting.</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <CENTER><A HREF="pics4/powder_DSCN0968.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics4/powder_DSCN0968-tb.jpg" WIDTH=152 HEIGHT=172 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1"><I>click on thumbnail</I></FONT>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH=160>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Above: Example of a tracking                  powder cloud, having ejected from a model that was                  stuck in its launcher.</FONT></P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=330>         <P><B>Engine </B>recommendations for         <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D</B></FONT> Eggloft Altitude</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D10-7</B></FONT> (light low-drag 18mm         models)</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=right VALIGN=top WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=10>         <P>or</P>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=10>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D21-7</B></FONT> (light low-drag         STRONG 18mm models)</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=330>         <P ALIGN=right>or</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D13-7</B></FONT> reload (light low         drag strong 18mm models)</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=330>         <P ALIGN=right>or</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D13-10 </B></FONT> reload (light low         drag strong 18mm models )</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=330>         <P ALIGN=right>or</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D12-3</B></FONT><B> </B>(heavy and/or         draggy model)</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=330>         <P ALIGN=right>or</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D12-5</B></FONT><B> </B>(low drag         lightweight model)</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=330>         <P ALIGN=right>or</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D12-7</B></FONT><B> </B>(high         performance low drag lightweight model if not too windy)</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=330>         <P ALIGN=right>or</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C6-0/C6-7 staged</B></FONT><B>         </B>(Low drag lightweight model if not too windy)*</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=330>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Staging C's is a fairly high risk way to         fly D Eggloft Altitude, not really recommended.</P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><CENTER class=MsoNormal style="text-align:center"><A HREF="#top">returnto top </A><A NAME=plans></A></CENTER><P class=MsoNormal style="text-align:center"><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Model Plans &amp;
