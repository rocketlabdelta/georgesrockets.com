In order to score         more theoretical vapor points for his model, Dave demanded         that HIS input be heard on the Scaleroc group, and progress         on a mission scoring guide come to a screeching halt.         Because Dave did not attend the meeting of scale fliers and         judges at NARAM-51, where the scoring outline was developed         which Dave did not approve of (NARAM-51 and 52 were yet more         NARAMs Dave said he was going to attend, but he did         not).</P>                  <P>Of course those claimed models were no-shows (and almost         surely never-existeds). And pretty much so is Dave almost         EVERY year he claims he's going to attend a NARAM (He's         claimed almost every year since 2003 that he was going to         attend NARAM, he only showed up for NARAM-50 and only flew 1         or 2 events, while the other models he bragged 2 months         before to be working on, were curiously absent).</P>                  <P>I know of nobody on Contestroc who believes Dave ever         actually built that G Superroc he claimed he'd built. He had         been asked several times by multiple people to produce a         photo of it, but he never did. Even though he's a         photographer.</P>                  <P>Some people just do things, and let their work talk for         themselves. Others just TALK (and type, and type and type         and type) but don't walk the walk.</P>                  <P>And some also don't pay their bets when they lose, even         when the cost would not be one cent, they just choose not to         live up to their agreements (If Dave lived up to a bet we         made, which he lost and reneged on, then he'd only post ONCE         a day on Contestroc).</P>                  <P>Why post this here? Dave often asks and asks and asks         about stuff but he doesn't follow up with any of it. He's         not a newbie, he's been in this hobby since the 1970's and         has been on Contestroc since 2003. So, he's not going to         build a flex-wing with a DT. And yet again despite claims         last fall, he's not going to NARAM (surprise!), so he         doesn't have any remaining excuse to claim he's going to         build any flex-wings, either.</P>                  <P>If Dave is unhappy with this, he can feel free to post         his response on his own rocketry website that he put         together, showing his articles, plans, and photos.</P>                  <P>And now we continue with the actual purpose of this page,         Flex-wings:</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><IMG SRC="Waporware.jpg" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 ALIGN=bottom><BR>         (vaporware)</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000CC"><IMG SRC="../../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#993300"><B><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=331>         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="+3" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099"><B>Flex-Wing         Gliders </B></FONT></CENTER>                  <P>Until 1988, Flex-wing Gliders were allowed to be flown in         Boost Glide. I first tried them around 1973 or so, and got         to be good at them.</P>                  <P>In 1980, I provided a lot of flex-wing notes to Craig         Beyers, who wrote up an article in the December, 1980 issue         of the Model Rocketeer (NAR Magazine name at the time). It         has a lot of information on how to make flex-wings, as well         as the pendulum type of DT that the Bulgarian Team had         developed. As well, it showed the "dead Duck" DT I have         developed to make a flex-wing fold one wing to dive straight         down (more effective and lighter than the pendulum DT).</P>                  <P>In Summer 1982, I wrote an article for the "Impact"         newsletter that Tony Williams and I edited. The focus of         that article was for how to build and adjust Flex-wings.         Scans of both articles are provided below.</P>                  <P>I should note that the "sewing" method to secure the         plastic is long outmoded. Despite what the 1982 article         said, it turned out that contact cement would work well         enough to secure the plastic to the spars. I thinned it with         some dope thinner. And curl the plastic a bit oversized for         the leading edges so that the contact cement could be         applied to the front, top, and bottom of the spars, with the         plastic wrapped around all three sides. Finally, I never         liked mylar for flex-wings. But for the models that Art Rose         &amp; I developed for the 1987 WSMC, the canard held to         solve pitch trim issues that I ran into when trying mylar,         which were not as bad with plastic. However, that canard         design was only really worth if due to how complex those         models were (essentially the flexie version of flop-wing         gliders).</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="45%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Scans130.jpg"><IMG SRC="Scans130-t.jpg" WIDTH=297 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="FlexWing-Scans138b.jpg"><IMG SRC="FlexWing-Scans138b-t.jpg" WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">Flying E B/G at                  NARAM-23<BR>                  Bob Ferrante at right</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">90&#176; simple Flexie                  and<BR>                  110&#176; DT'ed Flexie</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><A HREF="Scans134.jpg"><IMG SRC="Scans134-t.jpg" WIDTH=151 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         1980 M.R.
