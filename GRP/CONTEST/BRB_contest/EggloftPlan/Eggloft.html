Cut out the shroud, beingsure to leave the glue tab on it. Carefully start to roll up theshroud into a curl, avoiding causing wrinkles. It helps to start offthe curling by wrapping it around a tube or pipe. Start with a tubeor pipe about 1.5" in diameter, then use a smaller tube, pipe, or rodof about 1" diameter or so to curl it. When you get it curled arounda 1" diameter, then use a 1/2" rod or dowel to help curl it more. Bythat point you should be able to curl it tighter without usinganything inside. Curl it much tighter than it needs to be whenjoined. Try to curl it so it is curled about two wraps worth. Theidea is to curl it a lot smaller than it needs to be, then use somerubber bands to hold the tightly curled shroud in place and let itstay tightly curled for an hour or so. This way, the curl will "set"over time so when you remove the rubber bands it will uncurl to someextent but will be close to the correct amount of curl needed to glueit together.</P><P>For gluing, it is useful to have a 5/8" wood dowel or some similarcylinder smaller than a BT-20. If you are concerned about gettingglue onto the dowel or cylinder, apply some masking tape to protectit. Use 5-minute Epoxy or Carpenter's glue to glue the shroudtogether (White glue can also be used, and Cyanoacrylate can be usedtoo though it can be tricky). Apply the glue to the tab. Join theedges of the shroud together with the tab overlapping the joint. Youmay find it useful to use a couple of short pieces of scotch tape totemporarily hold the tab at the correct overlap while the glue isdrying.</P><P>The dowel or cylinder is used for applying force inside of the tabjoint. Put the dowel inside, under the tab joint, and use that as aninternal support so you can use your fingers to press down onto theoutside of the tab overlap joint. Let the glue set up well enough sothat the joint will hold after you let go. If you used 5 minute epoxyor CA, you can continue work on the model pretty quickly. If you usedCarpenter's glue or white glue, you'll have to allow plenty of timefor it to dry.</P><P>Now you can go on to the other steps.</P><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=150>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="66%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=150>         <P><A HREF="IMG_5115.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_5115-tb.JPG" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=77 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH="66%">         <P ALIGN=left>&nbsp;BT-20 engine mount tube:</P>                  <P ALIGN=left>Use the marking guide from the <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/BRB_contest/EggloftPlan/TwoMinuteEggPlan.pdf">Plans</A>         to mark the location for the three fins, and mark those         locations lengthwise on the tube,</P>                  <P ALIGN=left>Tie the Kevlar Cord to small centering ring.

Temporarily         push the mount assembly back up about an inch. Use a small         dowel or other object of about 1/8" diameter to "brush" some         white glue deep down inside the lower end of the shroud         (better yet, use a small brush taped to an extension).</P>                  <P ALIGN=left>Do this so you can glue the large centering         ring in place into the shroud. Be sure to get enough of the         white glue below the centering ring so that it will be in         the correct location to glue the ring once the mount         assembly is slid down fully. When complete, slide the mount         assembly down and check that it is aligned dead-center         through the shroud as it needs to be, that it is not         crooked. Finally apply some glue to the joint where the         shroud ends to secure the mount tube to it. Make SURE not to         let the Kevlar shock cord get glued to the shroud or         anywhere else other than the ring it is secured to, the cord         should protrude a few inches out of the top of the         shroud.</P>                  <P ALIGN=left><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">NEW TIP:</FONT> Some         have had trouble gluing the shroud joint together. An         alternative is to use <A HREF="23084-1005-2ww-m.jpg">double-sided         Scotch Tape</A> (has a yellow label). Get the "permanent"          type, and not the "removeable" type.To allow extra room for         the tape along the joint, cut out the shroud leaving the         "tab" part 1/2" wide all the way down, instead of being         tapered on the way down. It can be tricky to try to lay down         the tape full length long the tab area in one piece, without         being crooked. So, pull off about 3 to 4 inches of the         double-sided tape and lay it down onto the tab portion, make         sure it is straight, then repeat the process until there is         tape all along the tab area. Then you can carefully lay the         other side of the shroud over the tab area and press         together.</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=150>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="66%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=150>         <P><A HREF="IMG_5120.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_5120-tb.JPG" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=43 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH="66%">         <P ALIGN=left>Use the Fin Pattern to cut three fins from         medium 3/32" balsa.
