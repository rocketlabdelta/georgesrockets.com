Sometimes doing too well, staying up so long that the model         flies away, unrecoverable, or landing in an inaccessible         spot (or tree).</P>                  <P>The model must stay together, nothing can separate from         it other than wadding. It cannot be staged. If the egg is         not returned or is damaged (cracked, broken, etc.), the         flight is disqualified. You can NOT catch the egglofter, it         must be allowed to land naturally.</P>                  <P>For the <B>full rules</B> for this event, please see the         <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/pinkbook/34_ELD.html">Eggloft         Duration Rules</A> on the NAR web page.</P>                  <P><B>Scoring </B>- For Eggloft Duration only, the scoring         is best SINGLE qualified flight time, returned, of two         flights allowed.</P>                  <P><B>Design considerations</B> - Balancing ability to store         and reliably deploy a large parachute, with low model         weight. An all-18mm body with a capsule on top as used for         Eggloft altitude is not a good choice here since parachute         storage space is very limited.</P>                  <P>An egglofter with a long tapered conical shroud is a good         way to go, as it has a significant amount of parachute         storage space. The <A HREF="http://nar.org/competition/plans/pdf/twoMinuteEgg.pdf">Two         Minute Egg</A> plan is such a model, and both <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com">ASP</A>         and <A HREF="http://www.cybertravelog.com/qcr">QCR</A> have         similar contest oriented kits.</P>                  <P>A straight body tube with a larger diameter, such as 1.3"         to 1.65" diameter (BT-55, 35mm, BT-60) can be used. The         model will be draggier and usually heavier, of course, and         therefore at a competitive disadvantage. The Quest         "<B>Courier</B>" egglofter kit can be used for C Eggloft, it         is too heavy to use for B Eggloft. Some regular models you         might already have can be adapted to fly as an eggloft         duration model by replacing the nose cone with a capsule.         But they cannot be too heavy or they just will not fly         safely enough with the added weight of an egg.</P>                  <P>A <A HREF="#plans">list of plans and kits</A> is included         further down on this page.</P>                  <P><B>Egg Capsule</B> - <A HREF="http://www.pratthobbies.com">Pratt         Hobbies</A> makes an excellent vac-formed egg capsule (the         old CMR capsule). Some companies like <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com">ASP</A>         and <A HREF="http://www.cybertravelog.com/qcr">QCR</A> carry         that capsule. <A HREF="http://www.ApogeeRockets.com">Apogee</A>         also has their own vac-formed egg capsule.</P>                  <P>Another capsule sometimes used is a plastic Easter Egg,         of a size that is just a little bigger than an egg. Using         two "long halves" from two 1.75" diameter Easter eggs,         rather than one plastic egg due to the short half with a         flange sticking out, as the flange limits the inside         diameter too much. Easter Egg capsules that small can be         hard for the eggs to fit in and be safely cushioned,         however. "Grade A Large" eggs tend to vary significantly in         diameters, so Easter Egg capsules are somewhat risky, unless         you have an Easter Egg that is 2" or so in diameter. Since         this is for duration, it's best not to risk using a         too-cramped capsule.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>George has a supply of large Easter Eggs that can be used         for Egg Capsules. These e are somewhat larger than the         capsuels the 2-Minute egg plan is drawn for, George will         draw up a new conical body shord that is suitable for the         large Easter egg capsules. For existing BT-55 and BT-60         models you may have, the capsules can be added to the top,         in place of the nose cone, by gluing a tube coupler to the         base of the Capsule.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><B>Padding</B> - Use foam or some other flexible material         to try to cushion the egg so it will not get cracked. My         favorite basic cushioning is to get hold of a foam egg         carton and cut out the four corner "cups", as they fit the         egg pretty well. I add other thin foam padding as well. The         egg needs to be padded enough that it can't rattle, but         don't pack it so tight that it's under pressure loaded in         the capsule. If you are using a plastic capsule, don't         bother with putting the egg inside of a plastic bag....if         the egg breaks you can just clean the capsule with water,         without any damage.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=500>                  <P><B>Parachute</B> - The chute needs to be                  relatively big so it can get good duration, though                  hopefully not so big that the model drifts away.                  Very big chutes of 36" diameter or more are good                  for B Eggloft duration, as long as it can be                  deployed RELIABLY. While for C Eggloft duration, a                  high boosting lightweight model can drift too far                  away on even a 24" chute if there is much wind. It                  is best to have a number of chutes at different                  sizes, and select what seems most suitable for the                  wind.</P>                                    <UL>                     <LI>Andy Jackson of ASP (Aerospace Specialty                     Products) has written a <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/selectingeggchutes.html">great                     article</A> on considering what size or type of                     parachutes to use in egglofting competition,                     whether for duration or altitude. It also has                     tips on chute packing.</LI>                  </UL>                                    <P>Commercial chutes as sold by big manufacturers                  such as Estes can be used, of course. But such                  chutes are limited in size, are pretty thick, and                  are pretty inefficient due to only 6 shroud lines.                  Homemade chutes are better, you can have a larger                  diameter, use 8, 12, even 16 shroud lines, and use                  a thin material that packs well in limited space.                  Some people like to use 1/4 mil mylar, some prefer                  to use colored dry cleaner bags or other                  pre-colored very thin plastic, and some prefer to                  use 1/4 mil "dropcloth" plastic with color added by                  use of a large black or red magic marker. Another                  plastic chute material source, not as thin as 1/4                  mil dropcloth but pre-colored, is an inexpensive                  emergency poncho. The chute at right seems to have                  been made from a poncho or similar material.</P>                                    <P>ASP has a line of <A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/recoverydevices.html">"Over                  Easy" Parachutes</A> intended for eggloft duration,                  in sizes from 18 to 36"</P>                                    <P>A good shroud line source for homemade eggloft                  chutes is "button and carpet thread", which is what                  most manufacturers use.</P>                                    <P>To avoid the lines pulling loose from the                  parachute under stress, the shroud lines can be                  attached to run over the top of the chute as shown                  at right. Cut-up band-aid pieces can make for very                  sticky yet flexible shroud line tabs.</P>                                    <P>Sometimes a chute can be too big to get to                  deploy reliably, some people do better than others                  due to more experience and technique at packing.                  So, use parachute duration type packing methods.                  Practice packing chutes and try to work up a                  folding method that allows the chute to unfurl                  quickly and reliably.</P>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top>                  <CENTER>&nbsp;                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>click on thumbnail<BR>                  </I></FONT><A HREF="pics4/Egg_DSCN0329.jpg"><B><IMG SRC="pics4/Egg_DSCN0329-tb.jpg" X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></A><BR>                  2-Minute Egg type egglofter<BR>                  with a partly tangled chute</P>                                    <P>&nbsp;</P>                                    <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">                     <TR>                        <TD>                           <CENTER><A HREF="ChuteL.gif"><IMG SRC="ChuteS.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=121 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                           <FONT SIZE="-1"><I>click on                           thumbnail</I></FONT></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                  </TABLE>                  </P></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <P><B>Shock Cords</B> - It is useful to use a shock cord         that can actually absorb the shock of deployment , given the         weight involved with egglofters. 1/8" elastic works very         well for that purpose, but is not ideal to attach directly         to the body tube. Many competitors prefer to use a length of         100 pound grade Kevlar cord to attach to the body tube         (especially for mounting inside), then tie the elastic shock         cord to the other end of the Kevlar cord. The 2-Minute Egg         plan mentions using wire cable in a similar way to link         elastic to the model, that was a method used before Kevlar         came into use for contest models, so 100 pound Kevlar can be         used rather than wire cable for the 2-Minute Egg.</P>                  <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=320>                  <P><B>Engine </B>recommendation for                  <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B</B></FONT> Eggloft                  Duration:</P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B6-2</B></FONT></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=10>                  <P></P>               </TD>               <TD HEIGHT=10>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=320>                  <P></P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=320>                  <P></P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          <A HREF="#top">return to top         </A><A NAME=plans></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Model Plans &amp; Kits</B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=243>         <P><B>Designer</B></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>Notes</B></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P ALIGN=left><A HREF="http://nar.org/competition/plans/pdf/twoMinuteEgg.pdf">2-Minute         Egg Plans</A> (NAR website) &nbsp;<BR>         </P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=243>         <P>Plan by George Gassaway<BR>         </P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Good competitive plan for B and C power</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT=24>         <P><A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/eggimage.html">ASP -         Egglofter Kits </A>(various) &amp; Pratt Egg Capsules</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=24>         <P><A HREF="http://www.asp-rocketry.com/eggimage.html">ASP         (Aerospace Specialty Products)</A>, Andy Jackson</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT=24>         <P>Good competitive kits for B and C power</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/rockets.html">QCR -         Egglofter Kits using</A> "Easter Egg" &amp; "Pratt "         capsules<A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/rockets.html">         </A>for 18mm engines.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=243>         <P><A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/rockets.html">QCR -         Qualified Competition Rockets</A>, Ken Brown</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Good competitive kits for B and C power</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>QUEST - "<B>Courier</B>" sport egglofter kit</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=243>         <P>QUEST - <A HREF="http://www.modelaerospace.com/">Model         Aerospace Company</A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Not too competitive, but flyable on a C6-3.
