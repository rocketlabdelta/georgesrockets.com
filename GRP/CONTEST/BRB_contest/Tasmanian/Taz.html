It spins SO fast,         it reminded me off the old Cartoon character, therefore the         name. <A HREF="http://faultgame.com/images/tazsnd.wav">Click         here for a reminder of the sound</A> he made when spinning         up.</P>                  <P>It has also found use in contest flying, sometimes as a         "return" model, sometimes as a "qualified flight" model, and         even sometimes as a placing model when a contest would         likely have very few entries in the Copter event.</P>                  <P>It will only fly for around 6 to 8 seconds on a 1/2A. So,         it will not beat a Rotaroc that flies successfully. But         there may not be a lot of Rotaroc models flown. Especially         in the Junior Division. So this is an optional "Plan B"         approach that has its place.</P>                  <P>Tony Williams drew up a plan that has been printed in the         NAR's magazine twice, in 1986 and 2002. Tony's original         drawing is included, as well as two more pages showing an         <A HREF="TazPlans.pdf">updated PDF plan version</A> based on         the kit for the BRB contest.</P>                  <P>The kit model's main difference over the orginal plan is         the fact that I had a number of 14mm nose cones left over         from a glider design that did not work out, so the kit uses         a 3/4" long piece of 14mm tubing to join the nose cone to         the 13mm (BT-5) type body tube. If I had had enough normal         13mm (BT-5) type nose cones, the kit would use those         instead. If someone wants to scratchbuild one from their own         collection of parts, just use a 13mm (BT-5) nose cone, and         not the 14mm nose and 14mm tube.</P>                  <P><A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/BRB_contest/contest/helicopter.htm">Also         see the Helicopter Tips Page</A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=130>         <CENTER></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P>Read the following rows left to right, then down to the nextrow.</P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=6 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=130>         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="IMG_5145.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_5145-tb.JPG" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=78 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Comparison of Tasmanian Devil kit prototype and a very         old Rotaroc model.</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=130>         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="IMG_5148.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_5148-tb.JPG" WIDTH=107 HEIGHT=125 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>Prototype model ready for flight.</P>                  <P>The Prototype did not have any rounding or airfoiling of         the rotor blades.

If you build it using         Cyanoacrylate (CA) glue, that is great for the primary         assembly to get the parts to hold together. On this model         though, it is useful to go back and apply some Titebond or         white glue to make the CA joints stronger. Or, if you are         using a THICK type CA, then more thick CA serves the same         purpose. Regardless of type, watch out for glue running.</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=130>         <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_5399.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_5399-tb.JPG" WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=125 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P>The corners of the blades just about touch each other.
