Latch is based on a 1/16" brass torque rod which rotates         about 90 degrees when released. The working end of the         torque rod is a piece bent 90 degrees that sticks out about         1/8". It engages a notched piece of 1/8" aluminum rod that         is attached to 1/32" cable from the ET, when the torque         lever is pulled up 90 degrees. When prepped for flight, a         sliding "trombone" type 1/32" wire assembly locks the torque         lever in place. When the servo moves the trombone wire         assembly to the right, it no longer holds back the torque         lever arm, allowing the arm to pivot forward and to release         the orbiter from the ET. Note the semi-triangular opening in         the custom cut plywood arm of the servo, which allows         manually prepping the trombone/latch without having to have         the radio gear on.</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=200>         <CENTER><A HREF="Latch_notes.JPG"><IMG SRC="Latch_notes.JPG" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=168 ALIGN=bottom><BR>         Latch_Notes.jpg</A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD>         <CENTER>A modified version of the above image, to clarify         somewhat more how the latch parts work and what they look         like.</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=200>         <CENTER><A HREF="Hitec%20servos.jpg"><IMG SRC="Hitec%20servos-tb.JPG" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=73 ALIGN=bottom><BR>         Hitec%20servos.jpg </A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD>         <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hitec/RCD HS-60 servo (left)         and HS-50 servo (right).</FONT>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">HS-60 used for elevator, due to the         high loads on boost and greater need for precision in pitch         during glide.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">HS-50 used for rudder and for sep         latch.</FONT></P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=200>         <CENTER><A HREF="OMS%20Pods.JPG"><IMG SRC="OMS%20Pods-tb.JPG" WIDTH=57 HEIGHT=120 ALIGN=bottom><BR>         OMS%20Pods.JPG</A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD>         <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000">OMS pod fabrication.
