Its successful series of flights in October         has opened the door to build a "serious" shuttle model for         the first time, for Sport Scale at NARAM-41.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Orbiter is built mostly of         balsa, with a vac-formed nose (the orbiter was built in         1984, upgraded for this boilerplate). 3 Channel R/C: Elevons         for pitch control, movable rudder for directional control,         and 3rd servo for Orbiter sep from ET (sep commanded by         pilot). Glide mass 210 grams.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Flies on an F25 expendable motor in         the ET bottom, with an A3 motor in the Orbiter for "staging"         (OMS burn simulation).</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Vac-formed ET Nose has a Flight         Computer (by Jay Marsh) inside which senses Liftoff,         Burnout, and Orbiter sep. At liftoff a flight program         begins, when burnout is sensed the computer commands a servo         in the ET to separate the SRB's. Computer waits for pilot to         sep the Orbiter by R/C, then 1 second after Orbiter sep the         computer fires the primary ejection charge. The Orbiter         ignites an A3 motor for "staging" when it separates from the         ET.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">SRB's have wind-up Timers in their         noses which start timing when the SRB's are sepped from the         ET. About 2 seconds after sep from ET the Timer releases a         rubber band driven rod to push off the nose cone and deploy         the recovery system. Each SRB has a single fin oriented 45         degrees below the Orbiter wing, partially aiding pitch         stability but mostly proving ventral fin area to reduce         yaw/roll coupling from the orbiter vertical tail         (fin/rudder).</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Liftoff mass of the 1998         boilerplate is about 1000 grams, right a the FAI weight         limit for S7 (scale). However, there is room for reducing         mass such as using fiberglass tubes for the ET and SRB's,         and Ben Roberto is studying the feasibility of composite         construction of the orbiter. Such reduction in mass will         have to be done to allow for the weight to be added by         finishing, paint, and detailing that the boilerplate has not         had.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">More information on the 1998 model         is to be found below (scroll), as well as on the Details and         Pictures pages.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000CC"><B>Shuttle Model         History:</B></FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As some of you know, I've made         boilerplate and semi-scale models of the space shuttle for a         long time. The first one was a crude 1/80 orbiter in August         1977, the day after the first Enterprise ALT flight. It made         many nice piggyback flights before being retired due to wear         and tear in the early 1980's.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Next (1979) was a Full Stack (ET         &amp; SRB's) model at 1/110 scale, a sport flying model,         that flew on a single D12. A photo of it is in Doug Pratt's         "Basics of Model Rocketry" book. Its crude orbiter still         exists, having made a lot of piggyback flights.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Rocket Boosted R/C orbiters         began in fall 1982 with a 1/72 orbiter with slightly         enlarged wings, based on a heavily modified plan by Luther         Hux in Model Aviation magazine. It made approximately 30         flights on a special piggyback booster until 1989, mostly on         D12-0/D12-3 staged flights, but a few on F15 power. On its         final flight the piggyback booster's chute stripped causing         the orbiter not to sep, so it plummeted and was damaged         beyond practical repair.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In spring 1984 another 1/72 orbiter         was made with a scale sized wing, for a boilerplate of a         full stack shuttle. It was made partly as a test model for         what the US team hoped would be a fleet of shuttle models         entered in scale at the 1984 or 1986 WSMC, but the idea lost         steam. That full stack flew only 4 times with R/C, in 1984,         before being shelved.</FONT></P>                  <P><A HREF="72BP_flight1988.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-2"><IMG SRC="72BP_flight1988_s.JPG" WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=89 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="Clustershuttle_1988.JPG" WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=113 ALIGN=right></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">The         model was revived briefly as a non-R/C model to test out a         new fin system in 1988, a single fin on each SRB, which         worked well. The ET &amp; SRB's were later junked, the         orbiter is still flying, now with the 1998         boilerplate.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A couple of other shuttle         boilerplates were built and tested after that, but none R/C         or as big as 1/72 scale. One was about 1/100 scale using a         North Pacific styrofoam Orbiter, and another was 1/87 with a         balsa orbiter and BT-60 SRB's. Those test models showed that         it was too risky to try to power the shuttle with engines in         the SRB's instead of only using a single motor in the ET         bottom for the main power, but also too risky to even use         mini-A's in the SRB's for clustering points. The 1/87         boilerplate was the first to attempt SRB separation, using a         servo and R/C to sep on command. It worked, however the         orbiter came off of the ET every time the SRB's sepped so it         was never possible to study whether the orbiter and ET         coasted well after SRB sep or not.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In 1992 a large orbiter, 1/60 scale         was built, to fly on 32mm reloads (F13 or G12), using a         non-scale special piggyback carrier. It replaced the old         1982 model as an R/C Sport flying orbiter. Some of you have         seen that one such as at some NARAMs and a few Alabama         launches.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">December 1994 and January 1995 a         new 1/72 ET/SRB stack was built and the old 1984 scale         winged orbiter modified, to fly as an FAI scale boilerplate         model. The tubes came from the NCR shuttle kit, while the         rest was made from scratch (such as vac-formed ET and SRB         noses). It featured a number of improvements over the 1984         version, including SRB's to sep just after burnout (with an         attachment method first proven out in the 1/87 boilerplate),         with the SRB's deploying their own chutes. Unfortunately the         model crashed twice, once due to a bad homemade receiver         whip antenna (loss of signal and 180 degree turn at 70 up         during boost) and the second time due to far too much elevon         throw which allowed a "slight" pitch correction to put the         model out of control. At least the orbiter was sepped by R/C         both times so it didn't suffer crash damage that the         ET/SRB's did. Plans to develop it any further for an FAI         scale boilerplate were dropped partly due to the frustration         over the crashes, partly due to some kludge solutions that         would have to be totally reinvented, and also due to the         fact the boilerplate weighed in at 850 grams at a time when         the FAI limit was 750 grams.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One notable improvement in         launching shuttles was using a C-Rail launcher instead of a         rod. Some of the earlier models had rolled at launch due to         rod whip. The C-Rail reduces the tendency to roll. As well         it has turned out that it is easier to prep the 1995-1998         shuttle models by putting the ET on the C-Rail launcher,         attaching the SRB's, and attaching the Orbiter. Then carry         the launcher to the pad area. After launch, bring the pad         back to start prepping again. Yes, much like the Mobile         Launch Platform for the real shuttle is taken from the VAB         to the launch pad and after flight brought back to the VAB         for another stacking.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000CC"><B>August 1998         Flights:</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I've had a renewed interest in         building a shuttle now, and also the now FAI rules allow up         to 1000 grams. Shortly before NARAM-40 the old 1995         boilerplate was repaired enough to be flight-worthy at         NARAM, damaged tubes and all. No SRB internal chute         deployment system, damaged beyond use in the first 1995         crash, the SRB chutes simply attached externally and packed         tightly to fit into the space between the ET and SRB         tube.</FONT></P>                  <P><A HREF="N40_launch.JPG"><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC3300"><IMG SRC="N40_launch_s.JPG" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=2 ALIGN=left></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">It         flew 3 times at NARAM with a lot of things learned. The         first flight was the first time to have the SRB's sep and         the ET/Orbiter keep going. The SRB's sepped and tumbled much         like the real thing. Unfortunately the ET didn't eject its         chutes on that flight as the electronic ejection charge         didn't have enough black powder in it. Second flight was         almost ideal, though the SRB's were a bit late in sepping         (not quite enough spring strength to push back the sliding         engine casing to detect burnout). SRB's sepped after apogee,         Orbiter was sepped shortly after, and 1 sec later the ET         ejected its chutes. Third flight was a near-disaster as it         went into a barrel-roll bucking bronco boost. Sepped the         orbiter by R/C near burnout and fortunately the ET ejected         before hitting the ground. That flight's problem was pegged         on a loose rubber band. The forward portions of the SRB's         were literally strapped against the ET by external rubber         bands (for SRB release, a servo retracted a pin to release         one end of each rubber band, allowing a perpendicular spring         to push the SRB outwards). One of the bands had become too         weak and allowed an SRB to nearly come off during boost,         pivoting outwards a few degrees. This shuttle uses a single         fin on each SRB at 45 degrees down from the wing, so such a         pivoting outward by the SRB produced not only some odd yaw         but some right roll and down pitch by the fin attitude at         the unusual yaw angle.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The NARAM test flights of the old         1995 boilerplate were enough to show that it was worth         building a new ET/SRB boilerplate set, to improve on a         number of problems that the old one had discovered. Matt         Steele donated a number of 4.6" and 2" tubes from the old         NCR 1/72 shuttle kit to this project, and Mike Dorffler         donated a few BT-80's used for the Computer/Recovery housing         module. Special thanks as well to George Rachor who         videotaped the first two flights which were very useful in         reviewing the flights.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">SRB's: The rubber band external         strap method for forward SRB sep was replaced by an internal         latch system. Actually this system had been designed for the         1995 boilerplate but at the last minute it was found not to         work due to a problem with how the SRB recovery system was         supposed to work, so the external rubber band straps were a         kludge fix (a return to the method used by the 1/87         boilerplate). The SRB's got the recovery system fix they         really needed, since in the 1995 boilerplate they were to         deploy right at SRB sep and that not only had caused the         internal latches to bind but could have caused a snag at SRB         sep. The new SRB's got their own timers to deploy the chutes         about 2 seconds after sep. Electronics and pyrotechnics         would involve excess mass and problems of arming safely. So         instead the original concept of a rubber-band driven dowel         to push off the SRB nose was revived, but with a wind-up         timer and latch to keep the dowel from pushing off the nose.         The wind-up timers come from small cheap "Tomy type" toys,         in this case $1 crawling bugs. A 180 degree disk is attached         to the wind-up shaft so that the disc engages a lever arm         that holds the dowel down. When the disc rotates 180         degrees, the lever is freed and lets the rubber band drive         the dowel forward. A perpendicular rod that presses into the         disc, the other end pressing into the ET, is what keeps the         Timer running until the SRB has sepped and the rod slides         outwards.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">(For more on the SRB's see the         Details and Pictures pages)</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Another major upgrade was in the         electronics. The 1995 version used a simple servo driver         circuit with two possible servo positions for the SRB's, one         to hold them on and one for Sep. Sensors for that were a         mercury switch (preventing accidental triggering on the         ground) and a special "thrust switch" (engine slides freely         so presses on the switch under thrust, with a spring strong         enough to push the engine back as it nears burnout). There         also was a simple timer (old NCR "Veet-1" timer) for the         ejection charge, timed to fire 1 second after the orbiter         sepped (a switch in the ET pressing on the         orbiter).</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 1998 version has a Flight         Computer designed and programmed by Jay Marsh, which he         developed for the FAI Saturn IB models that he and Tom         Campbell flew at the 1998 WSMC in Romania. The F.C. makes         use of two "Basic Stamp" microcontrollers, made by Parallax,         working together for different portions of the programming.         The shuttle F.C. was a slightly modified version of one of         Jay's Saturn IB F.C.'s. , but with a lot of different         programming. It has a capability to check continuity for the         primary ejection charge, and to fire a back-up ejection         charge. It has 3 inputs that it gets from the main ET: a         Liftoff sensor, Orbiter Sep sensor, and Thrust sensor (No         more need for merc switch safeguard due to the Liftoff         sensor). The programming handles how normal flights should         go, as well as a limited range of contingencies when         something is not working correctly such as no burnout         detected 1 second after the selected motor should have         burned out, in case the engine getting jammed in the mount         and not sliding back (that is, if SRB sep is overdue, the         F.C. will ignore the Thrust sensor and sep them). On a         regular flight the SRB's sep when burnout is sensed, and the         ET does not eject until the orbiter has sepped (though there         is a long window by which either the orbiter has been sepped         by R/C or the computer will assume the orbiter sep has         failed or not sensed properly and it will eject anyway). The         F.C. beeps out a single digit number to indicate preflight         and postflight status. A beep of 1 is good, all OK. If         something is not good then it beeps the number for each         error found, such as orbiter sep detected which is a very         bad thing to be detecting before liftoff (and which did         occur before a flight). Fortunately the programming does not         try to sep the SRB's or fire the ejection charge(s) until         liftoff has been detected, safeguards that the original         crude electronics did not have. And in any case it cannot         fire the ejection charge until it is fully armed.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The model is armed using the same         method as Jay Marsh developed for his IB models, and as many         do for HPR models which use electronics. 3/32" jacks are         used for "Remove Before Flight" type plugs. One is used for         power to turn the computer on. The other is for actual         arming of the ejection charge. Before launch first the         computer is turned on by removing the power plug and         listening for the OK error beeps. When OK is heard and just         before countdown, the ejection arm plug is         removed.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The orbiter has a similar power and         arming jack/plug arrangement as well. The "arm" is for         ignition of an A3 motor in the orbiter, to score 30 points         for "staging" under FAI rules (simulating an OMS burn). When         the orbiter seps from the ET, a switch closes that ignites         the A3. If the A3 does not ignite the orbiter can be too         tail-heavy to glide, coming down vertically but fuselage         level (literally a belly-flop).</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000CC"><B>October 1998         Flights:</B></FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This 1998 boilerplate was test         flown 8 times in October. First three flights were at a US         Team get-together and practice in Muncie, Indiana the first         weekend in October. There was some apprehension not only         about flying, but the Flight Computer too since the first         time the fully programmed F.C. was installed in the         boilerplate was Friday night in Muncie, when Jay Marsh         arrived. Jay provided the F.C. 2 weeks before for some         interface, wiring, and installation work, with some crude         programming to give feedback on sensor switch positions.         Only had it for a few days then needed to send it back for         final programming (He did a lot of programming in parallel         at the same time, using one of his Saturn IB prototype         F.C.'s). Fortunately everything worked out in static         testing, including the F.C.'s response to simulated         out-of-normal flight conditions.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Saturday's flying was rained out,         there was just enough time to get in 3 flights on Sunday.         All worked for the most part, with some problems with         weathercocking and the orbiter being tail-heavy the first         two times, not gliding but falling flat. First time it did         that due to the A3 not igniting (didn't plug in the leads         correctly), second time (with a fired A3 in place) the CG         was just totally missed. Third time all worked well,         including the orbiter gliding down. The flights were         significant in proving the new improvements worked,except         for screwing up the A3 staging. The Flight Computer worked         fine, SRB wind-up timer/deployment systems worked fine, and         the ET ejection system worked fine. I had wondered mid-way         thru the development of the wind-up timers if they were         going to work out well after all, but they did prove out to         work well and still keep on working.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The flying in Muncie was also         notable by the style that occurs when flying on a team like         that. There was some significant landing damage to the         orbiter from those flat landings onto a gravel parking lot,         Ben Roberto took over to do the repairs and have the orbiter         ready when the ET and SRB's were prepped and ready for         flight. Others also pitched in with the prepping. And after         flight they helped recover the six separate parts of the         model.

There was one near-disaster, with a bucking bronco type of         boost which seems to have been due to one of two SRB aft         attachments not being seated right. Waited for burnout then         sepped the orbiter, while the FC sepped the SRB's and 1 sec         later ejected the ET. However the ET did hit hard, I was         watching the orbiter so I don't know if it even got the         chutes open (the orbiter staged about 30 feet off the         ground, fortunately pointing horizontally and giving it         enough forward airspeed to be controllable by R/C in glide).         One flight failed to stage, the orbiter didn't fall         vertically flat but stalled too badly to control. If that         happens again I'll probably just give full up and let it do         a full vertical descent belly-flop. One of the flights was         just about perfect, SRB's sepped before apogee, let the         orbiter/ET coast over apogee and beyond for about 2 secs         from SRB sep then sepped the orbiter and it fired         horizontally. </FONT><IMG SRC="SRBsep3.GIF" WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=80 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=right></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Greg Warren videotaped these         flights,as with George Rachor's and Bob Biedron's tapes         these have all proven valuable in analyzing just what         happened since there's a lot of things going on and too many         parts to keep track of at the same time.</FONT></P>                  <P><A HREF="pix2/Descent1_of_shuttleparts.JPG"><IMG SRC="pix2/Descent1_of_shuttleparts_s.JPG" WIDTH=143 HEIGHT=100 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=left></A>Shown         at left are the ET and SRB's after orbiter sep and staging.

The Space program has had         boilerplates, such as Mercury and Apollo capsules. As         regards building scale flying rocket models, a boilerplate         is a crude model meant to test some or all aspects of how a         later "real" scale model will fly. If there is an inherent         flaw in the design, better to find it out using a         boilerplate model with a lot less invested in it than an         actual scale model if something goes wrong.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Why not fly it with engines in         the SRB's?</B> Reliability. The SRB's are so far apart that         any imbalance in thrust or out of sync ignition of the         motors will introduce a yaw that would put the model out of         control. It's too high of a risk for a model with so much         time being put into it, and given the results of the tests         through the years. Therefore it is powered by a single         engine in the base of the ET.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>What about small motors in the         SRB's for cluster points?</B> Tried it a few times with a         1/87 boilerplate. First time the F in the ET was late to         ignite, the A3's lit took it up the rod, slid down the rod,         damaged an SRB attachment and then when the F did come to         thrust all hell broke loose 30 feet up as the damaged SRB         came off. Later a special device was built for the pad so         that the flashbulbs to the SRB mini-A's would not ignite         until the model raised up 1/2" up the rod, for launch,         avoiding the problem with late ignition of the F motor.         About half the time one of the SRB's did not ignite...and         once neither ignited, which was really bad since the only         way those SRB's got any chutes out was by the ejection         charges of those motors. So, OK, it's still possible to add         some small motors to the SRB's just for cluster points but         the risks seem to outweigh the benefits.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Is this model from the old North         Coast kit?</B> Distantly. It does use 4.6" and 2" tubing         from the old NCR kit.... thanks to tubes donated by Matt         Steele. The kit's balsa ET nose has been used as a master         for vac-forming hollow cones, using .080 plastic sheet. And         the kit's aft dome was used for casting a solid master to         then use for vac-forming new aft domes. By the time an FAI         model is built none of those parts or vac-form masters will         be used.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Why a wind-up timer in the SRB's         instead of electronic/pyrotechnic charges?</B> Electronic         systems for the SRB's would add additional weight, the mass         of the timer and whatever mass of the batteries needed to         fire a flashbulb. And such mass is doubled since there are         two SRB's. There is also a problem in trying to devise a         means of arming/safing the electronics to avoid accidental         firing.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>What about deploying landing         gear?</B> Not worth the added complexity, fragility, and         extra mass.

I found the         original R/C orbiter from 1982 to be far too sensitive to         fly with mixed elevons. On its first flight I tried to turn         it and it did a 360 roll before I could react. Reduced the         aileron control down to 1/32" up and 1/32" down, but still         found it hard to fly since I never have had much experience         flying ailerons. One day it finally happened, "lost it" in         glide and it spiraled in. In rebuilding it I gave it a         moveable rudder instead, and that made all the difference in         the world. Very smooth control, a lot easier to fly. Ever         R/C orbiter since has flown that way with movable rudder         instead of mixed elevons.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But there are two things about         using rudder on the Orbiter. One is that if the full height         rudder moves, it can act like a vertical aileron in glide,         at low angles of attack, causing control reversal. Once         built a big cardboard orbiter to throw off a 30 foot cliff,         and found out the hard way...in a shallow dive it rolled         right when I gave left rudder. On another throw with a         higher angle of attack the left rudder created left yaw and         a bank to the left. The key is to make only the lower part         of the rudder move. As can be seen in pics of the 1/72         orbiter, the movable part corresponds with the split portion         of the rudder on the real shuttle. That is plenty adequate         area for directional control in glide, and even roll control         during boost.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">And that is the second thing about         using rudder control on the orbiter, boost. During boost it         does act like a vertical aileron, so left rudder causes         right roll. The fix to that is to set up the transmitter so         that when in Boost Mode the rudder has opposite throw to get         the desired result (left stick commands right rudder,         producing left roll), then when flipping a switch from Boost         to Glide mode the throw is normal.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The model is controlled by a Futaba         8UAF transmitter. Much thanks to Futaba for supporting the         1998 US S8E Team, and to Don Edberg for the tip on how to         program the inflight rudder reversal trick for boost. I am         using Switch D for the Boost Mode/Glide Mode switch. It not         only handles rudder reversal but also dual rates for rudder         and elevator, Glide trim (channel 7 knob mixed into         elevator), and to automatically command the Orbiter Sep         servo to the Sep position to release a latch.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Both the 1/72 Orbiter and 1/60         Sport orbiter use Hitec/RCD 555 Receivers with Deans whip         antennas (Also have used Cannon Super Micro Rx's).
