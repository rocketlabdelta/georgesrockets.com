The technical details were mostly the same as for         the 1998 boilerplate, except for no attempt to add an A3         "staging" motor mount to the orbiter.</P>                  <P>Orbiter construction was similar to the 1984 orbiter - a         balsa fuselage, wings, and body flap, with a vac-formed nose         section. However the vertical tail (rudder) was vacuum         formed, not balsa. Other details included OMS pods (mostly         vac-formed, with hollow-cast aft thrusters and OMS engine         nozzles),<A HREF="NARAM_41/TangoPapaDecals.GIF"><IMG SRC="NARAM_41/TangoPapaDecals.GIF" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=175 ALIGN=right></A>         vac-formed heat shield domes, and hollow-cast SSME's. The         vac-formed and cast parts were painted, many as fully         painted and decaled sub-assemblies that were added to the         orbiter at NARAM, such as the OMS pods, and the plug-on         vertical tail (rudder) assembly. The balsa parts were         covered with Towerkote, an iron-on model airplane covering.         The Towerkote left a bit to be desired due to some minor         wrinkling in spots that was too scary to attempt t o iron         back out from fear of making things worse. The orbiter nose         and rest of the orbiter was masked off to allow for first         painting the vac-formed nose gloss white, then masked         further to apply flat black to the front portion of the nose         and underside of the nose. The side portions of the nose         were not painted black, instead once the paint was dry         enough to do decaling some solid color black decal sheet was         cut to shape and applied. The nose thrusters and other black         portions of the nose section were mostly reproduced by using         some decals I drew up which were printed by <A HREF="http://www.tangopapadecals.com/">Tango         Papa Decals</A> (examples shown at right at 2X or 1/36         scale). The custom drawn decals also included the orbiter         cockpit windows, overhead windows, aft T-0 umbilical plates,         and gray circles for the aft OMS thrusters. Remaining         portions of the nose and wing glove section had pieces of         black decal cut to the necessary shapes and applied. The         black hinges along the bay door sills were simulated with         black adhesive trim Monokote, which was applied by team         member Jay Marsh. The remaining "markings" on the orbiter         were from the 1/72 decal set made by <A HREF="http://www.realspacemodels.com/">RealSpace         Models</A>. After all the decals were applied and dried, the         orbiter was painted with Model Master's clear flat lacquer.         That's when it transformed to look "real", up to that point         it was shiny white Towerkote, shiny black Towerkote,         semi-shiny black solid color decal, shiny white paint, and         flat black paint, once the flat coat dried then everything         was uniformly flat white and flat black, and the clear film         around the edges of the decals didn't appear either. The         last parts put on were the main engines, which could not be         added till after the flat coat or they would have lost their         metallic appearance.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="80%">                  <P>The External Tank (ET) was also much like the                  1998 boilerplate ET internally. However to cut mass                  it used a fiberglass body tube, made by Jay Marsh.                  The ET aft dome, which before either was not on                  boilerplates or used a vac-formed copy of the                  inaccurate NCR kit aft dome, was to the correct                  shape thanks to a wooden vac-form mold turned by                  Jack Hagerty. Also for the first time the intertank                  was simulated fairly accurately, thanks to a                  laser-cut pattern made by Tom Campbell. The                  cardstock lasercut pattern was used as a master to                  produce an RTV mold. Then the RTV mold was used for                  creating epoxy/fiberglass wraparounds (the pattern                  was for 180 degrees so two were needed). Additional                  detailing was added, some by making RTV molds of                  Monogram shuttle kit parts then casting the parts,                  others by building up from scratch (such as the                  pipe/conduit strips). For the orbiter separation                  sensor, a very small microswitch was mounted into                  the Lox line where it enters the orbiter on the                  real thing, the switch pressed down by the orbiter                  until it seps. The wiring was run up inside the Lox                  line all the way to the intertank. For painting, a                  spray can type of Red Oxide primer by Wal-Mart                  turned out to match the colors of this mission. For                  the lighter yellow-orange color of portions of the                  tank, "Daylight Orange" by Polly-S was airbrushed                  onto separate parts before final assembly (in                  retrospect it's a bit too orange). For other areas                  where it was not practical to paint the part                  separately, particularly the bands along the top                  and bottom of the intertank and a band below the                  "beanie cap" on the ET nose, white decal sheet was                  airbrushed with the Daylight Orange color then                  portions of the now solid color Daylight Orange                  decal sheet were cut to shape and applied. Pieces                  of the orange decal were also used on the simulated                  support brackets of the pipe/conduit lines.</P>                                    <P>The ET nose was similar to the boilerplate,                  vac-formed using an old NCR shuttle balsa ET nose                  as the master pattern, except this one had added                  detailing and the need to hide the flight computer                  power and ejection arming remove before flight                  pins. On the boilerplate no attempt was made to                  hide them, using regular 3/32" phone jacks. For                  this model, small lever switches were built into                  housings so that a 1/32" pin could be pressed into                  place to hold the switch lever down. The                  orientation was chosen so that acceleration (or                  deceleration) on boost would not cause the lever                  arms to move once the pins were removed. This                  approach allowed hiding the holes for the remove                  before flight pins between a pipe and conduit strip                  running down from the ET nose. It is visible in the                  photo at right but it seems the judges didn't                  notice. The Orbiter used a similar method, with its                  1/32" hole aligned with a 1/16" hole in one of the                  RealSpace Decals.</P>                                    <P>The SRB's also were technically the same as for                  the boilerplate, except for the use of fiberglass                  tubes made by Jay Marsh. The SRB's used the same                  kind of wind-up timers for recovery system                  activation. However the fins were different,                  instead of plywood glued externally, the NARAM                  model SRB's used .06" Lexan fins, with a 7/8" long                  tab glued inside the vac-formed aft skirt. It is                  not easy to tell in photos but the portion of the                  fin ahead of the aft skirt is not attached to                  anything, it parallels the side of the body tube                  with about a 1/16" gap. Only with fin material as                  sturdy and strong as Lexan, particularly .06"                  thick, can such a trick of using just a tab be                  acceptable structurally and for the not-too-high                  flight loads (this does come at some price, notably                  higher fin mass, and even Lexan could snap given                  such a relatively small tab). Details such as the                  hold-down struts, aft sep motors, and the forward                  portion of the system tunnel came from using the                  Monogram kit parts as masters for RTV molds and                  casting with Alumilite. The systems tunnels                  themselves were 1/8" wide half-round from Evergreen                  scale models. The SRB noses were hollow-cast from                  an RTV mold based on the Monogram kit. The                  "hollow-cast" method used for those noses and the                  orbiter SSME's was the slush-cast method, where a                  small amount of resin (with some microballoons in                  this case) is poured in, the mold rotated around                  horizontally cement-mixer style to coat the mold                  inside, then pouring out some excess and                  continually rotating the mold by hand until it sets                  up stiff enough. With a fast-curing resin like                  Alumilite that is practical, anyway, but does take                  some time and trial and error to master the                  technique.</P>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH=280>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0>                     <TR>                        <TD ALIGN=center>                           <P><A HREF="NARAM_41/dcp00430.JPG"><IMG SRC="NARAM_41/dcp00430.JPG" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=288 ALIGN=middle></A></P>                                                      <P>&nbsp;</P>                                                      <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD>                           <P>&nbsp;</P>                                                      <P>&nbsp;</P>                                                      <P><A HREF="NARAM_41/dcp00428.JPG"><IMG SRC="NARAM_41/dcp00428.JPG" WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=216 ALIGN=middle></A></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                  </TABLE>                  </P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          SRB painting involved first using white primer to get the         tubes smooth, then after applying external parts using         another coat of primer before going to gloss white. Krylon         white primer and gloss white was used for those purposes,         not as fine as some other paints but having had some         painting problems earlier in the year on the X-20/Titan-II I         went with what was reliable in the past. Actually first I         had tried to use just gloss white on the tubes and found         that the fiberglass tubes really need to have a primer, some         discussion with Bob Biedron and Jay Marsh showed me how         silly that idea had been to not use primer. There was no         paint other than the white, but the SRB's are not just         white. On several missions, the SRB noses had a complex         series of markings, which are no longer used. But I liked         them, gave the shuttle a bit more of a complicated look even         if it was just a little black paint. On this model those         markings were done by using black decal material, cut to         shape. A pattern was drawn up for the three different         shapes, and after tweaking to get the size and shape just         right, the printed patterns were rubber-cemented onto the         black decal sheet, then the patterns cut out. After cutting,         the paper pattern was peeled off from the black decal,         thanks to the rubber cement. The decals were applied using a         good amount of setting solution to make sure they snuggled         down into the ridged surfaces of the SRB noses. Some round         decals for the noses were cut out of black decal by         sharpening the end of the correct diameter of brass tubing         and using a small mallet to punch them out. Same was done         using some silver decal material to punch out small round         silver dots to apply over the locations of the separation         rockets on the nose. Red decal was used for the strip on the         lower portion of the nose. More black decal was used for the         upper part of the SRB tubing, and some white decal, 3 layers         thick to increase opacity, was used to simulate the access         panels near the top of the SRB's (Yes I know those should be         slightly recessed...). The various bands on the SRBs,         including the field joints, were simulated by using         different widths of black and white striping tape. No         attempt was made to achieve the 3-Dimensional shape of the         three lower stiffening rings which include the foam ramps.         The foam ramps were simulated by the same orange decal         material as used on the ET (thanks to Jay Marsh for applying         those at the last minute plus Dave Faulkner doing "super         soaker" duty). The SRB nozzles were vac-formed, and painted         a tan color. They were attached to the SRB's last, using a         Hobby-Tac contact cement that has interesting properties of         a contact cement while not attacking paint, almost like a         cross between contact cement and rubber cement. The same         Hobby-Tac contact cement was used to attach the SSME's to         the orbiter as well as a few small details to the ET.</P>                  <P>The whole model never was together until minutes before         taking it to turn-in Monday night. Ed LaCroix brought in the         neat display stand he made up, freshly painted black. The         build-up process began with putting the ET onto the stand,         then the SRB's, then the ET nose, and finally the         orbiter.</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>The Flights</B></FONT></P>                  <P>As some of you know, the first flight did not go well. It         took off OK, flight path was OK, even sepped the SRB's OK.         But from there things went badly.</P>                  <P>There were about 3 separate problems on the first flight         it seems, and of course none had cropped up before in the 9         previous flights of the 1998 version boilerplate the NARAM         model is based on. First was the ET nose came off shortly         after the flight computer commanded SRB sep. The ET nose had         been a bit loose and now I know it was too loose. That is a         major problem for this since the ET nose has 6 wires         connected to the main ET by means of a 6-conductor telephone         jack/plug set, and when the nose came off it no longer could         "see" orbiter sep that the computer uses as a key event to         fire the ejection 1 second later. But the programming is         supposed to fire the ejection if the orbiter is "late" in         separating, there's a 4 second window from         computer-commanded SRB sep to sep the orbiter by R/C. I do         not know at the moment if the programming did not account         for that condition or something as basic as the computer         battery also going out about that time. So in any case it         was fortunate that at least the ET main chutes got yanked         out, since all the chutes are stored tightly in about 4" of         space in a BT-80 in the ET nose (chutes meant to be blown         out rearward by a piston when an electronic ejection charge         goes off). And it seems the ET nose chutes got out (?) but         didn't deploy, which if that was the case is a totally         separate and screwy problem if both were out and both failed         to deploy. Again, have to check video footage.</P>                  <P>The last goofy thing was that the orbiter didn't sep when         commanded by R/C. I later found there was a problem in the         programming I did in the computer transmitter where the         transmitter's landing gear switch position affected the         throw of the sep servo, I didn't realize the gear switch was         in the chain of the programming (in other words I had needed         to disable the gear switch from a default setting and         overlooked it). To do the actual separation I flip a         different switch, a boost/glide master switch, which is         programmed to not only sep the orbiter but to change values         for throws and to change the elevator trim for "uptrim" for         glide). Considering that the orbiter never sepped, and it is         not known yet why the computer didn't cause ejection once         the allowed orbiter sep window expired, it might have been         fortunate after all that the ET nose came off and at least         got the ET main chutes out. If the ET and orbiter had         plummeted down, there would have been little more than two         SRB's left from that model.</P>                  <P>The ET main's chutes were not meant to bring the ET and         240 gram orbiter down together at the same time, so not only         was the landing rough on the ET, bashing in the vac-formed         aft dome, but also rough on the orbiter (which of course was         not intended to "back into" the ground). The body flap was         knocked off, one OMS pod popped off, one of the main engines         was damaged, and a balsa spar inside the vertical tail         (rudder assembly ) was cracked. Also one of the elevons was         bent upwards by 10 degrees, fortunately it was possible to         bend it back (The brass rod used as a torque rod on that         elevon was bent).</P>                  <P>Jay Marsh and I set about doing repairs. There were a few         moments during the attempt to get it ready to fly again that         it looked like it might be "game over". Foremost was the         flight computer. It was not responding at all, and         considering the ET nose had crashed then it was looking like         the computer was damaged. Jay carefully checked it over to         try to pinpoint the problem. Fortunately it turned out to be         that the 50 mAh 9.6 volt nicad pack was bad, one of the         solder tabs must have broken loose when the ET nose hit.         Fortunately there was a back-up wiring harness to plug in         series two 4.8 volt 50 mAh packs as used for R/C RBG's. So,         the computer "took a licking but kept on ticking" (didn't         hurt that it was mounted inside a hardened "capsule").</P>                  <P>Also for awhile the aft launch lug was missing (not known         if it came off at launch or landing). The model is C-rail         launched and has to have two lugs. If it had not been found         then then it was likely the remaining upper lug would have         been cut two halves and gluing one of the halves to the         bottom. Good thing it didn't come to that.</P>                  <P>The ET/Orbiter attachments were also of concern. The two         1/16" brass pins that go perpendicular from the ET aft         struts inside the orbiter to transfer the acceleration         (push) loads to the orbiter were broken away forward, the         cast struts had cracked along the 1/16" holes the pins were         mounted into. Fortunately those were fixable by applying         thick CA. Various other repairs to other pieces too, mostly         minor. It was at least fortunate that no key part was         damaged, or damaged beyond repair - there are some pieces         where there is no practical field repair possible if they         break, like an aft SRB/ET attach strut....."game over".</P>                  <P>Finally it was all fixed and ready to fly again. It         pitched a little bit off-vertical but not too badly, and         shortly after burnout the computer sepped the SRB's. OK,         that's where flight 1 stopped going well. This time, ET nose         stayed on, and the orbiter/ET coasted along for about 2         seconds then I commanded orbiter sep and it came off         cleanly, right into a glide (unlike the 1998 boilerplate,         this one was not built to "stage" by firing an A3 in the         orbiter at orbiter sep).</P>                  <P>Now glide was the part of the flight that was a big         question in the previous months. There never was any         opportunity to check the glide trim of that new orbiter         (Well, if I'd really wanted to I would, but it's too big a         risk to do with a "real" scale model) . The best that could         be done was to try to build it to be aerodynamically the         same as the boilerplate orbiter (built in 1984, 15+ years         before), and get the glide CG just right...if it was 1/4"         tail-heavy it would not even glide but "mush" like the real         thing does during re-entry. So, would it glide? Would it be         controllable? How much trim would have to be dialed in         during a glide that was going to last 20-25 seconds? As it         turned out, the CG was just about right, and the elevator         trim was about right. It did pull a bit to the left, but         rather than try to add right rudder trim I just flew it and         held a little right stick. Made one large sweeping turn , it         had separated and gone into a glide pointed downwind, so I         turned it to the right for a 180 degree turn and the landing         was into the wind, about 150 feet or so from the contest         range. Everything else worked, SRB's deployed their chutes,         ET deployed main chutes and ET nose deployed its chutes         (dual chutes everywhere). Qualified flight, easily taking         first place in Team Division</P>                  <P>It was a great relief to have it work, and a lot of         excitement too. As I said at the banquet, some people asked         me how long it took to build the model. One answer is it         took two months, but another answer is it took 22 years.         Many of you know I've made shuttles and orbiters of one kind         or another thru the years, some for fun, some for         boilerplates, but none for contest flying. Indeed the first         orbiter, a very crude free-flight 1/80 piggyback orbiter,         was built 22 years ago, the day after the first Enterprise         ALT flight. This is eerie, I checked some resources and see         that Enterprise's first ALT flight was August 12th, 1977. So         I built my first orbiter August 13th, 1977. The NARAM-41         shuttle flight was EXACTLY 22 years later....</P>                  <P>The second flight didn't cause any significant new         damage. The ET nose had extra tape added to the shoulder to         make it a tighter fit so it would not slip off. And as it         turned out...it was too tight. For the first time since         using Jay's flight computer, on flight #11 (9 boilerplate, 2         NARAM model), the back-up ejection charge also fired. The         back-up charge is fired 1/2 second after the primary, on a         good ejection the back-up charge is unplugged as the         ejection piston is blown out. Since the 2nd charge fired         then obviously the first charge didn't eject the nose fully         or at least didn't blow the ejection piston out of the ET         nose.</P>                  <P>Looking to the future, the orbiter damage can be fixed by         replacing some removable sub-assemblies, like replacing the         cracked main engine. The ET though needs to have a new aft         dome added which will be a not-fun affair to replace a part         meant to be permanently glued. But it sure beats building a         new ET. The ET nose will have to be replaced, it's         vac-formed shell was cracked and while flyable it's         judge-worthy days are over. But the ET nose is the one "big"         part of the model that is the easiest to replace, I'd rather         replace the ET nose (long as the flight computer didn't have         to be replaced too) than say the orbiter's removeable         vertical tail (rudder) which has far more time invested in         it than most people would think.</P>                  <P>Jay Marsh entered the flight computer project in R&amp;D         at NARAM. The computer was originally built for his         Saturn-IB models, but is basically the same as used for the         shuttle model, just different programming. He was going to         make a demo flight for the R&amp;D judges Friday at NARAM         but they told him it wasn't needed and given the trees and         wind he chose not to fly. But the shuttle model happened to         serve as an unofficial demo of the computer. In any case,         Jay's flight computer won R&amp;D at NARAM in Team         division.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="#top">Back to TOP of page</A></CENTER>                  <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/GRP-1.jpg" WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=59 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=60>         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><A NAME=top></A><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../SCALE.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to SCALE</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../SHUTTLE.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to Shuttle</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to                  George's</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><A HREF="shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Shuttle                  HomePage</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
