Collect as many photos as possible, of different angles and         details. This is because every mission is unique in some         ways. Even two back-to-back missions of the same orbiter can         be different, if only due to different light orange/yellow         "splotches" on the ET. Over a longer period of time, even         the orbiters look different. Such as dirtier, duller tiles         (re-entry heat cycles), new tiles replacing some old dull         damaged tiles, and the late 90's change to the NASA         "Meatball" markings and white upper elevon hinge seals. ET's         have gone thru different versions, in 1998 the lightest         version came into use, which has a lighter shade of         yellow/orange insulation and is prone to localized "sunburn"         darkening at the pad. SRB's have used different markngs over         time, and after Challenger's last flight there were various         modifications to the SRB's, notably heater bands. A good         reference for the differences for the first 40 shuttle         missions is Mike Mackowski's Space In Miniature #3 - Space         Shuttle booklet</P>                  <P>That said, if a person cannot obtain enough photos to         document one mission completely, other photos of other         missions might be of some use for various details and so         forth (It might not be impossible to obtain enough photos to         document everything in detail for a specific mission, but         it's very very difficult). But it always must be kept in         mind as to whether what is seen in those photos is relevant         to a specific mission. A modeler might find them useful in         determining how to make a certain part or do some details,         but it would be bad to include such photos of other missions         in a data pack.</P>                  <P>Unfortunately, many photos here do not have ID's for a         specific mission. Some which have a number like 98 near the         beginning might mean a photo taken of a mission flown in         1998, or is a photo of STS-98. Where there seems to be         numbers of a logical sequence, you can go onto NASA's Image         Exchange (NIX) site, type in that number, and see if it         comes up. In preparing this I do not have the time to do         that for all photos. &nbsp;&nbsp;http://nix.nasa.gov/</P>                  <P>For photos where a mission is known, suffixes have been         added to the original photo number. For example, photo         number KSC-96PC-0912.jpg was changed to         KSC-96PC-0912_STS-79_SRB.jpg.</P>                  <P><A HREF="HTMLshuttlepics/STS47.html"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>STS-47</B></FONT></A>         - Photos of STS-47, orbiter Endeavour. Of special note         because it was longtime NAR member and former NAR trustee         Jay Apt's second mission, and that it was launched on a date         when many people who came to attend the 19992 WSMC in         Melboure Florida were also able to see it. This is the         mission George Gassaway has modeled.</P>                  <P><A HREF="HTMLshuttlepics/Endeavour_notSTS-47.html"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Endeavour         not STS-047</B></FONT></A> - Photos of Endeavour on other         missions.
