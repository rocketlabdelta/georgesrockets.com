The LES         was a set of solid motors mounted on a tower atop the Apollo         Command Module. In the event of a catastrophic failure of a         Saturn V or Saturn 1B launch vehicle on the pad or early in         the boost phase the LES motors would ignite and pull the         Apollo capsule, with its three astronauts, to safety. The         Little Joe II provided a relatively inexpensive way to test         the LES over the range of velocity and dynamic pressure         conditions expected in a Saturn flight profile. A similar         program to man-rate the Project Mercury Launch Escape System         used a booster called the Little Joe, so the name Little Joe         II was chosen for the Apollo test booster.</P>                  <P>The Little Joe II was designed and built for NASA by the         Convair Division of General Dynamics. Five Little Joe II         vehicles were flown; the first was a qualification test of         the launch vehicle itself, and the last four were flight         tests of the Apollo LES. The launches were conducted at the         White Sands Missile Range between August 1963 and January         1966. Table 1 summarizes The LES qualification project also         included two Pad Abort tests to simulate an abort while         still on the launch pad. Although these tests do not involve         the Little Joe II booster, photos of the pad abort vehicles         (simply a Command Module and LES) provide data relevant to         the Apollo payloads flown on the Little Joe II vehicles. The         first pad abort mission (PA-1) was flown on November 7, 1963         using Apollo "boilerplate" capsule BP-6. The second (PA-2)         was conducted on June 29, 1965 using the BP-23 that had         previously been flown on the Little Joe II mission A-002.         Both tests were successful, the LES carrying the CM to         sufficient altitude for deployment of the main         parachutes.</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000CC"><B>Little Joe II Vehicle         Description</B></FONT></P>                  <P>The drawing at right shows a typical Apollo/Little Joe II         configuration. Although each of the five Little Joe II         vehicles was unique in detail configuration and payload         dimensions, they are similar in overall structure and paint         patterns. This article will describe the differences between         vehicles so that the modeler may construct any round.         Vehicle station (STA) positions are measured in inches from         the STA 0.0 reference point at the top of the upper forebody         splice ring. Distances rearward are given as positive STA         values; distances foreward (into the payload area) are         negative STA values.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=350>         <CENTER><A HREF="Joe_GIFs/A-004-50scale.gif"><IMG SRC="GraphicsJ/ArticleColorJoe.gif" WIDTH=308 HEIGHT=738 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=bottom></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=30>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000CC"><B>Propulsion</B></FONT></P>                  <P>The versatile Little Joe II could be flown with a variety         of solid propellant motor configurations, depending on         mission requirements. The body could hold up to seven large         Algol 1D motors, or a combination of fewer Algols could be         used with smaller Recruit TE-29 motors. All of the Recruits         and some (or all) of the Algols were ignited at launch as         the "booster" stage; the ignition of some Algols could be         delayed until later in the flight to provide "upper stage"         or "sustainer" thrust. The motor combinations used gave the         Little Joe II a rapid liftoff, not at all like the slow         liftoffs associated with Apollo Saturn launches.</P>                  <P>The Algol 1D motor was produced by Aerojet General. It         had an average thrust of 96,530 pounds, a burn time of 42.1         seconds, and a total impulse of 4,068,000 lbf-sec (making it         an "X430000-engine" in model rocket parlance). Mod II Algols         had straight nozzles, and were used in the center motor         mount only. Mod I Algols were equipped with nozzles that         could be canted to a preset angle of up to 14&#176;, and         were used in the outer motor mounts.</P>                  <P>The Recruit motor was produced by Thiokol, had an average         thrust of 37,100 pounds, a burn time of only 1.536 seconds,         and a total impulse of 57,000 lbf-sec (making it a mid-range         "R165000-engine"). Recruits mounted in the center position         had straight nozzles. Recruits in the outer positions had         canted nozzles (some sources list the cant angle as         6.5&#176;; others say 9&#176;).</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=7 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos3/Algol-QTV.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/algol_qtv-t.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Algol Motor for QTV</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos3/s633252.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/s633252-t.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=162 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Recruit Motor Nozzle for QTV</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos3/s6313528.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/s6313528-t.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=162 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Motors loaded into QTV Lower Body</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=350>         <CENTER><A HREF="Joe_GIFs/Article-Bottomview.gif"><IMG SRC="Joe_GIFs/Article-Bottomview-t.gif" WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=257 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A>                  <P><A HREF="Joe_GIFs/MotorConfig.gif"><IMG SRC="Joe_GIFs/MotorConfig-t.gif" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=213 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to top</A> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=bottom><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=30>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000CC"><B>Structure</B></FONT></P>                  <P>All Little Joe IIs had the same body construction. Both         the forebody (STA 0.0 to STA 227) and the aftbody (STA 227         to STA 350) were built from corrugated aluminum skin panels         stabilized by internal structural rings. The corrugated         aluminum skin eliminated the need for longitudinal support         stringers, resulting in a lightweight, inexpensive         structure. Each body subassembly was made up of 12 panels,         each panel 10 corrugations wide (plus overlap), riveted         together to give a total of 120 corrugations around the         body. These panels were formed by Alcoa Aluminum Company on         the same equipment used to make corrugated aluminum siding         and roofing, so modelers who use plastic model railroad         siding to simulate the corrugations on their models are         doing essentially the same thing General Dynamics did.</P>                  <P>There were three primary thrust support structures within         the vehicle. The main thrust bulkhead (bottom at STA 347)         formed the rear of the aftbody and had seven 36" diameter         motor mount openings for the Algol motors (or, with adapter         fittings, Recruit motors). Six external "T"-cross section         thrust longerons (two long, four short) transfered thrust         loads from the base bulkhead to the aftbody skin. The lower         fin mounting lugs were also part of the main thrust         bulkhead. The upper fin mounting lugs were the only         externally visible parts of another aftbody support bulkhead         that was located at STA 278.8. A splice ring was located at         the top of the aftbody.</P>                  <P>The forebody support bulhead was located at STA 34.75 and         held the tops of the Algol motors in place. The six tie-down         lugs and two launcher mast fitting hooks on the exterior of         the forebody were anchored to this bulkhead. Most of the         Little Joe II's electrical equipment was attached to this         bulkhead or located in the open space above it. Access to         this equipment compartment area was provided by three doors         in the outer skin. Splice rings were located at the top and         bottom of the forebody.</P>                  <P>Air conditioning for the Little Joe II while on the         launch pad was provided by hose connections to two small         doors located on the aftbody, and to one of the equipment         compartment access doors in the forebody . Photos of the         Little Joe II on the launcher often show air conditioning         hoses connected to these doors, or show the doors with the         hose adapters in place (e.g., NASA photo 65-HC-991).</P>                  <P>The Little Joe II had two wiring tunnels, one running the         length of the whole body, and one running just the length of         the aftbody. The wires were simply laid into negative         corrugations (corrugation depressions or "gutters") and         sheets of aluminum were attached over the top. Fairings         allowed the wires to pass around outside the splice rings at         STA 227 and around the base thrust bulkhead. The bottom         fairings had umbilical connectors which provided contact to         the ground support cables.</P>                  <P>The only substantial body detail differences between the         five Little Joe II vehicles were the positions of externally         mounted antennas. Table 2 specifies the antenna types and         positions for each vehicle.</P>                  <P>Both the forebody and aftbody had noticeable rivet lines;         longitudinal lines located along the body panel splices, and         circumferential lines where internal support rings and         bulkheads were located. Modelers interested in rivet level         details on the body skin are advised to get an enlargement         of NASA photo 64-H-2456, or to visit and photograph one of         the two remaining Little Joe II vehicles.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=350>         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A HREF="JoePhotos/A-003/S-65-13573.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos/A-003/S-65-13573.jpg" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=572 ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         12-51-2 body, for A-003<BR>         NASA Photo # S-65-13573</P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=30>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <CENTER><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/Article.gif" WIDTH=553 HEIGHT=702 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=7 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos4/c093a.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos4/c093a-t.jpg" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  QTV</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos/A-002/S-64-31084-tb.html"><IMG SRC="GraphicsJ/S-64-31084-mt.jpg" WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </A>S-64-31084.jpg<BR>                  A-002</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos/A-004/S-65-19770-tb.html"><IMG SRC="GraphicsJ/S-65-19770-mt.jpg" WIDTH=173 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </A>S-65-19770.jpg<BR>                  A-004 Aft Body</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=350>         <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos/A-002/64-H-2456-tb.html"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos/A-002/64-H-2456-m.jpg" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=423 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         12-51-1 body, for A-002 (short fin root fairings)<BR>         NASA Photo # 64-H-2456                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos3/s633159.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/s633159-t.jpg" WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos3/s633162.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/s633162-t.jpg" WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER>QTV Assembly</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER>QTV - Fore Body</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos3/s6412339.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/s6412339-t.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos3/s6313544_1.jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos3/s6313544_1-t.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER>QTV - Motor Installation</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER>QTV - Mounting Fixed Fins</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to top</A> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=bottom><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=30>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000CC"><B><BR>         Vehicle Guidance</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Two versions of the Little Joe II were produced. The         12-50 series vehicles were unguided, utilizing fixed fins         for stability (not unlike gigantic, metallic, model         rockets). The 12-51 series vehicles had active guidance         control: An Aerodynamic Control System utilizing fins with         movable elevons; and, in some cases, a Reaction Control         System using hydrogen peroxide fueled thrusters.</P>                  <P>Fairings mounted around the roots of the fins on 12-51         series vehicles housed the RCS and part of the ACS         equipment. The rest of the ACS hydraulic system was mounted         internally and externally on the fins. The first 12-51         vehicle (12-51-1) for flight A-002 used a short fin-root         fairing; later 12-51 vehicles had larger fin-root fairings         to accomodate a dual-supply hydraulic system. The         Aerodynamic Control System allowed 12-51 series vehicles to         perform pitch-up maneuvers prior to abort to increase         dynamic pressure on the test vehicle. The Reaction Control         System utilized eight 600 pound thrust motors, and was         designed for use at liftoff (while airspeed was low) and at         high altitudes where the ACS would be ineffective.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=350>         <CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=7 WIDTH=340>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="GraphicsJ/MovableFin.jpg"><IMG SRC="GraphicsJ/MovableFin-t.jpg" WIDTH=124 HEIGHT=215 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  A-002 Fairing</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="45%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="GraphicsJ/Fin-movable.gif"><IMG SRC="GraphicsJ/Fin-movable.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=215 ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">A-003 &amp; A-004                  Fairing</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to top</A> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=bottom><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=30>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000CC"><B>Payloads</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Most of the payloads carried by Little Joe II vehicles         were "Boilerplate" Apollo capsules. A boilerplate is a test         article with the same size, mass, and center of gravity as a         production spacecraft. The boilerplates do not include all         the active systems of a production spacecraft, but they         usually include equipment to measure and record engineering         data during the test. The first mission (QTV) carried a         dummy Apollo supplied by General Dynamics. The final mission         (A-004) carried SC-002, a "Block&nbsp;I" production model         Apollo spacecraft.<BR>         </P>                  <P>On all missions (except A-001 &amp; QTV) the Command         Module was covered by a Boost Protective Cover (BPC). The         BPC protects the CM during boost and would be jettisoned         along with the escape tower during a normal Apollo launch.         The BPC has two parts; a rigid forward section, and a rear         "soft" cover. Many photos of Little Joe II vehicles on the         launcher show the soft BPC either partially or completely         missing (not yet mounted).<BR>         </P>                  <P>The Launch Escape System is made up of three separate         solid-fueled motors. The main launch escape motor that         actually pulls the CM away from the booster has four canted         nozzles, a thrust of 147,000 pounds, and a burn time of 3         seconds (a "U-engine"). A pitch control motor, mounted near         the LES nose and pointed horizontally, also ignites at abort         to deflect the capsule away from possible booster debris.         The pitch motor has a thrust of 2,850 pounds and a burn time         of 0.5 seconds (a wimpy "M-engine"). Between the main escape         motor and the pitch motor is mounted the tower jettison         motor, with two nozzles canted out through the sides of the         LES (where they appear as elliptical openings). This motor         fires to pull the LES away from the CM, either after an         abort or after successful second stage ignition during a         normal flight. The separation motor has a thrust of 32,000         pounds and burns for 1 second (a "Q-engine").<BR>         </P>                  <P>On all missions (except A-001 &amp; QTV) the Launch         Escape System was equipped with nose canards. These canards,         part of the escape tower nose structure, were folded flush         during boost. Eight seconds after escape motor burnout the         canards swung out to flip the Launch Escape Vehicle (CM +         LES) around and stabilize it in a heat shield-forward         attitude, allowing more reliable CM parachute         deployment.</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=350>         <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=340>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=9>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos2/apmisc-BP12-A-NOID(A-001).jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos2/apmisc-BP12-A-NOID(A-001)-t.jpg" WIDTH=138 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=9>                  <CENTER><A HREF="GraphicsJ/63apollo222.jpg"><IMG SRC="GraphicsJ/63apollo222-t.jpg" WIDTH=124 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=150>                  <CENTER>BP-12 for A-001</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH=150>                  <CENTER>BP-12 descent</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=150>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos4/c134b.gif"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos4/c134b-t.jpg" WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH=150>                  <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos2/apmisc-65-H-677(A-003).jpg"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos2/apmisc-65-H-677(A-003)-t.jpg" WIDTH=119 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=150>                  <CENTER>BPC &amp; LES Drawing<BR>                  </CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH=150>                  <CENTER>BP-23 for A-003<BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Lower BPC Panels not installed                  yet</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to top</A> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=bottom><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=30>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000CC"><B><BR>         Colors and Markings</B></FONT></P>                  <P>The Little Joe II body, fins, and fairings were left in         their natural aluminum finish. The base ring skin and splice         rings were also natural metal color, but were darker than         the body. The upper splice ring at STA 227 usually appears         darker than the lower ring in photographs, but this is         probably an effect of overhead lighting on the slighlty         slanted surface. The "UNITED STATES" lettering at +Y and -Y         was black. The General Dynamics plaques on the base ring had         black lettering on a polished aluminum background. The base         of 12-51 series vehicles (including fairing bottoms and fin         trailing edges) were covered with RTV silicone rubber as         thermal protection, and had an off-white color. The 12-50         series vehicles had bare metal bottoms. The Algol nozzles         were painted white, but Mod I (canted) nozzles appear to         have had a black, flexible covering around the throat area         of the nozzle (possibly as protection for the nozzle cant         angle adjustment mechanism). The color of the Recruit motor         nozzles is unknown, but they appear dark in photos.</P>                  <P>The dummy Apollo payload carried on the QTV mission was         silver in color, with a shifted variation of the standard         black roll pattern on the dummy SM. All other Apollo         payloads were painted white with standard black roll         patterns. Large "black dots" that appear at the rear of the         boilerplate Service Modules, and on the mating ring below         the SC-002 SM, were actually vent holes for pressure         equalization. Note that, except for the A-001 mission, the         Command Module was covered by a Boost Protective Cover. The         Command Module had the same black-on-white roll pattern that         was on the BPC, but the CM also had a 6" tall reddish-orange         stripe around the base (the A-001 BP-12 CM did not have this         stripe). The Command Modules (not the BPCs) also had "UNITED         STATES" and American flag markings in two places.

The abort actually         occured outside the targeted test window, but at an even         greater dynamic pressure than expected, so the test was a         success, with the CM landing safely under three 'chutes.         Dynamic pressure is represented by the symbol "Q", so this         was labeled a "Max-Q abort".

The other fins and the         RCS system tried to compensate, but were unsuccessful, and         the roll rate of the vehicle increased until centrifugal         forces resulted in disintegration of the Little Joe II at         12,400 feet. The LES sensed the failure and initiated an         emergency abort, successfully pulling the BP-22 capsule away         for a safe recovery, a consolation prize for the Apollo         engineers.

The LES was modified (by removing nose ballast         and tilting the escape motor nozzles to produce a net thrust         vector 3.4&#176; off vertical) and the Little Joe II was         pitched-up prior to abort to insure that the Launch Escape         Vehicle (CM+LES) would tumble during the firing of the abort         motors. This resulted in the soft BPC ripping off and escape         motor thrust impinging onto the CM, but the abort was         successful and the capsule was recovered in fine shape.

Airframes 12-50-3, 12-50-4, and 12-51-4         were not flown and two of them still exist on display. One         of the 12-50 series vehicles is on display at the Lyndon B.         Johnson Spaceflight Center near Houston, Texas. The vehicle         is sitting on the Little Joe II launcher used in White         Sands, and is mated with the Boilerplate capsule BP-22         (flown on A-003), a Launch Escape Tower, and a Block II         Service Module. Strangely, the vehicle is not equipped with         the fixed fins that would be expected on a 12-50 series         model, but instead sports the movable-elevon fins and the         lower part of the fin-root fairings that belong on vehicle         12-51-4. A bit confusing, but still an excellent opportunity         for photographing details of the body, fins, and fairings         (as long as you understand the situation). The short wiring         tunnel cover plate is not on the aftbody. The roll patterns         on the LES and SM are incorrect, and the CM lacks a Boost         Protective Cover. Because the vehicle is sitting atop the         launcher, modelers cannot reach it to make measurements.</P>                  <P>Little Joe II number 12-51-4 is on display at the         International Space Hall of Fame Museum in Alamogordo, New         Mexico, topped by a Block II SM, dummy capsule, and dummy         escape motor. A set of fixed fins and just the tops of         fin-root fairings (the bottoms of which are on the Houston         Joe) are mounted on the vehicle. The display provides         excellent photo opportunity for those interested in body         details and fixed fins, and the vehicle is mounted low         enough to allow measurements of the bottom sections.</P>                  <P>The Boilerplate BP-23 Command Module (flown on A-002 and         Pad Abort-2) is on display at Marshal Space Flight Center at         Huntsville, Alabama.
