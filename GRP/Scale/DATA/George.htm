It was                  also my first with balsa fins, and first scale                  model (previous 5 had been MPC kits). As with Tom                  Beach, the Historical Brochure that came with that                  kit left a lasting impression.</FONT></P>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1975, I got a Centuri 1/45                  kit. It was flown a lot usually with a D12. It was                  even used for design out "Abort Staging", with a                  mini-A engine in the base of the Capsule. I still                  have it, , but it is in bad shape. I also have an                  unbuilt 1/45 kit in storage.</FONT></P>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1989, I teamed with Wayne                  Hendricks (Southern Comfort Team). Wayne had been                  interested in our team developing a scale model of                  the Little Joe-II, and had built his own 4"                  diameter prototype. Plus for sport flying he loved                  flying 7 engine clusters in a Little Joe-II model.                  I had not considered doing a Little Joe-II as a                  serious scale model before, as my scale skills in                  early years were poor. But by 1989, they were                  getting a lot better. I found ways to do the three                  most critical parts of the model - scratchbuilt LES                  Tower, corrugated body, and the UNITED STATES                  Lettering to conform accurately to the                  corrugations. And Wayne arranged to get an aluminum                  mandrel made up for vac-forming the                  Capsules/BPC's.</FONT></P>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As part of preparing to build a                  serious model, I contacted Tom Beach who was known                  to be a collector of data and expert on the Little                  Joe-II. The Centuri Historical Brochure had some                  flaws (no BPC information), and I did not even know                  how many corrugations to model. One thing led to                  another as we collaborated in the drawings and                  article that ran in the May/June and July/August                  1991 issues of American Spacemodeling magazine (now                  Sport Rocketry).</FONT></P>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Even before the data was                  created, I built models in early 1990.

And then a model for NARAM-42 in 1990. </FONT></P>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">For some info on how the models                  were built, use this link to jump to the                  </FONT><A HREF="#regional"><FONT SIZE="-1">assembly                  of the Regional                  Model</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1">.</FONT></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="50%">         <CENTER><B><BR>         Little Joe-II at JSC - Houston, Texas</B><BR>         <A HREF="George/RGaff-N21-Joe-1.jpg"><IMG SRC="George/RGaff-N21-Joe-3.jpg" WIDTH=412 HEIGHT=300 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         George (far right) with Little Joe-II and launcher at JSC,         during NARAM-21 (1979)<BR>         Rick Gaff photo - Mark Bundick in foreground.                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="George2/N34-JoePad2-crop.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><IMG SRC="George2/N34-JoePad2-crop-t.jpg" WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="George2/N34_Launch.jpg"><IMG SRC="George2/N34_Launch-t.jpg" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="George2/N34-JoeCatch.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><IMG SRC="George2/N34-JoeCatch-t.jpg" WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="George/LJBoilerplateCluster.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><IMG SRC="George/LJBoilerplateCluster-t.jpg" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><A HREF="George2/N-37-George-Jay-LittleJoe.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><IMG SRC="George2/N-37-George-Jay-LittleJoe-t.jpg" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><A HREF="George2/WSMC-1992-G_Harry-m.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><IMG SRC="George2/WSMC-1992-G_Harry-m-t.jpg" WIDTH=68 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><A HREF="George/Gaff-N-48-Joe.jpg"><IMG SRC="George/Gaff-N-48-Joe-t.jpg" WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=bottom></A></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>NARAM-32 Sport Scale - 1990</B></P>                  <P><B>A-004 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/39.5 Scale</B></P>                  <P><B>Near Dallas, Texas</B></P>                  <P><B>Southern Comfort Team - 1st place</B></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Regional model had worked out nicely,         winning the regionals it was flown in at Alabama contests.

Unfortunately, the CM caught a thermal and flew away!

This one was for A-002,         perhaps he first time anyone had modeled A-002 for a NARAM         (or any meet?). I used more advanced fabrication methods for         that model than I had for the previous ones. Especially         regarding Alumilite cast parts and RTV molds. The Peanut         model suffered a bit due to its tiny size. The UNITED STATES         lettering was done by clear decal, and the clear decal film         was visible, so that hurt the score somewhat. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It took Second Place in Team Division, to         Team Neutron's Tiny Saturn-IB (Jay Marsh and Ed LaCroix), We         would merge teams later to create the Southern Neutron         Team.</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="15%">         <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos6/IMG_3673.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos6/IMG_3673-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         </FONT><A HREF="JoePhotos6/IMG_3667.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos6/IMG_3667-t.jpg" WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         With Photo 64-H-2805</FONT></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="26%">         <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos6/IMG_3655.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos6/IMG_3655-t.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         </FONT><A HREF="JoePhotos6/IMG_3663.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos6/IMG_3663-t.jpg" WIDTH=226 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         With Photo 64-H-2456</FONT></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="JoePhotos6/IMG_3766.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos6/IMG_3766-t.jpg" WIDTH=274 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1">American         Spacemodeling issues,<BR>         with Peanut and Quest models</FONT><A HREF="JoePhotos6/IMG_3732.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos6/IMG_3732-t.jpg" WIDTH=279 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         Removeable Base plate, slight burn damage.</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>NARAM-34 Super Scale - 1992</B></P>                  <P><B>Las Vegas, NV (dry lakebed site)</B></P>                  <P><B>Southern Neutron Team - 1st place</B></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This was quite a challenge, to build a         Scale Pad to go with the 1990 NARAM Little Joe-II.

For one, I replaced the original         engine mount with one for 7 engines. A 24mm engine in the         center, and six 18mm engines. I did not test it on 7 engines         though, I only got around to doing a test with three, a D12         and two C6's.</P>                  <P>The other test was for "abort staging". I modified the         BPC cone to hold an engine mount in the base of it, plus a         system to deploy a parachute to recover it. And added a         mercury switch system into a 1" long ejectable piston that         fit in the upper part of the SM, just under the BPC cone, to         both house the electronics and to keep the recovery system         of the Main Body from being roasted by the A3 engine inside         the BPC. It flew and worked out just great. Later I did a         similar BPC Abort test with a 4" model, and C6 engine in the         base of the BPC. It worked, but I decided not to pursue it         for the Contest models due to the reliability risks.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><A HREF="George2/CenturiJoe-Wayne.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><IMG SRC="George2/CenturiJoe-Wayne-t.jpg" WIDTH=229 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><BR>         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica">George and Wayne         Hendricks</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><A HREF="George2/CenturiJoe-Cluster.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><IMG SRC="George2/CenturiJoe-Cluster-t.jpg" WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><BR>         </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica">Ready for flight         at a HARA launch</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" CELLPADDING=4>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME=regional></A></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#0000CC"><B>LITTLE         JOE II MODEL ASSEMBLY INFORMATION</B></FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Assembly pictures </B></FONT>- The         1/39.5 Regional model assembly in 1990</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">A         Boilerplate model was built to explore the construction         using corrugated plastic sheet curled into a tube, fin         attachment, and BT-80 tube for recovery compartment (with a         printed wrapper for the Service Module pattern).

It was cast with four         metal pins to help to anchor the tower skirt to the 3/32"         LES tower legs. The LES legs were hollow, so the pins could         be glued in (Plastic glues do not work with casting Resin).         When the Skirt was cast, the metal pins had heads sticking         into the resin area, so that the pins would be truly         anchored. Simple straight pins would have easily slipped         out. The pins also were scraped up a bit, and a slight hook         bent into the end (not shown), otherwise smooth straight         pins could have slipped out from inside a tower leg despite         the glue.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Unfortunately,         I did not end up making any new models to make use of the         cast parts like the Hard BPC and Tower Skirt.

Pieces of Plastruct "U" Channel (dark gray in         the photo) were glued into place as jig guides. The tower         legs, cut oversized, were taped in place. The horizontal         struts were cut to length and glued in using Liquid Cement.         A printed pattern helped in determining the length to cut         the horizontal struts, an also for the 45 degree braces         which were glued in later. The last step was cutting out and         gluing in the diameter brace, not seen in the photo at         right. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Once one         of the 2-leg assemblies was done, it was removed and a         second two-leg assembly made in the same manner. When fully         dry, then both sets of assemblies were placed into the jig,         on their sides, set at 90 degrees, and taped in place so         that the third of four sides could be built. I found it         useful to use Tweezers to put the parts into place. Once         that was dried enough o be structurally sound , the tape was         removed and the tower rotated 80 degrees so that the 4th         side could be built. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Once the         fourth side was done and dried, it was removed from the jig.

Care was needed         since the liquid cement could also soften the joints and         make them let go. To get a nice build-up of plastic at the         joints, to help fill in any crevices, I used a near-empty         bottle of liquid cement to put some scraps of plastic into,         so the plastic would dissolve, so that could be brushed on         as a sort of liquid filler. It was still more liquid cement         than plastic.</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=400>         <CENTER><A HREF="George/TowerJig.gif"><IMG SRC="George/TowerJig-t.gif" WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <A HREF="JoePhotos6/IMG_3750.JPG"><IMG SRC="JoePhotos6/IMG_3750-t.jpg" WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">At right         is the NARAM model's BPC/LES, as seen at NARAM-34 (Tom Beach         photo).
