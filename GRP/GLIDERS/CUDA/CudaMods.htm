Personally there are several mods I would do, one of         which is to ditch the wooden pod (lasercut balsa fuselage)         all together. You can use the entire boom that comes with         the 'Cuda (don't cut it at all) and let that be the         "fuselage" and put the receiver and battery in the motor         tube (use the one that comes with the kit, it is extra long         and that is handy for this type thing) and then make a motor         mount pylon ala this and put the servos in that.</P>                  <P>http://web.mac.com/parky/RavenNine/Photos.html#6</P>                  <P>That is what Chad Ring did with his 'Cuda kit and I think         it is a good way to reduce some of the crackability on the         old Cuda while also reducing mass and frontal area.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="../S8/Raven9/DSC_1910.jpg"><IMG SRC="../S8/Raven9/DSC_1910-t.jpg" WIDTH=247 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Raven-9 type "stick" boom with servos in hollow pylon,         receiver &amp; batteries in Rocket Motor pod</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="5%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P><B>Jim Filler replied:</B></P>                  <P>I did my my first boosts this past spring with another         flyers model. I finished my Cuda and brought it to N-50. The         problem IMHO is the stock model turns out to be very tail         heavy because the "old" electronic equipment that is         recommended was much heavier from what I've been told. I had         to add over 35 grams of weight to get mine close to the         recommended CG and the model still wanted to stall real bad.         I went back to the board after N-50 and used some of Greg's         tips for his "slim cuda pod" What I did different was to         extend the nose on the fuselage by 3". I replaced the pod         area completely so I could shift the gear forward to get a         good CG. In Sept I took it out and had some real nice         flights, one over 15 min. with an E6.</P>                  <P>The only other item that I mentioned prior was that the         model is not legal for S8 the wingspan is just shy. You         mentioned some ways in a prior post to alter this either         prior or post build.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="Cudapics1/IMG_0279.JPG"><IMG SRC="Cudapics1/IMG_0279-t.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=179 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="5%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P><B>George Gassaway replied:</B></P>                  <P>What I have always recommended is this: Unless you have         done V-tails before, use the "T" tail option, as seen on Jim         Filler's model at right and above right. This is because the         servo motion, and linkages and control horns have to be dead         equal between left and right. If not, then you will have up         elevator introduce some unwanted turning, or right rudder         causing some unwanted pitch response.</P>                  <P>Something else I am going to recommend is to build the         wing with "Tri-hedral", instead of the 6-piece wing with 5         panels. So, flat in the middle, then the outer parts angled         for dihedral (a left panel and a right panel) . The 5-panel         wing is a bit more efficient dihedral-wise in more closely         approximating a "perfect" elliptical dihedral, but I do not         think it is worth it. Trihedral saves a little bit of mass         by only having three wing joints instead of 5, plus there         are two less joints to cut just right and glue together just         right.</P>                  <P>If you did not get what I mean about Trihedral, then at         right is a photo of one of the <A HREF="CudaFlap.htm">Cuda-Flap         models</A> I made, to use for the 2001 US Team flyoffs for         the then-new S8E-P event with the runway type landings. It         used a 16" flat section, with each tip raised 3.75" for         dihedral.</P>                  <P>I called it Cuda-Flap since it used a modified set of         Cuda wing cores, and the same V-tail size, but the fuselage         layout was totally different. I do not recommend much else         about that model configuration beyond the 3-panel Trihedral         wing.</P>                  <P>Another mod I suggest:</P>                  <P>The 1/16" balsa sides are a bit weak, and the laser-cut         slots make them a bit weaker. So, once the main fuselage is         built, but not sanded, add 1/64" plywood, or .010         G10/Waferglass, to the sides to reinforce them. I used to do         that a lot with my old balsa fuselage R/C R/G's to beef them         up. Another option would be to not add the side strips, go         ahead and add the bottom balsa blocks, carve and sand all of         the lower pat of the fuselage , then apply one layer of 3/4         oz. fiberglass cloth, using the same kind of epoxy used for         skinning the wings. I would just go with the 1/64" ply,         since that is what I did for many other models.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER>Jim Filler's Cuda with "T" Tail&nbsp;<BR>         <A HREF="Cudapics1/IMG_0278-crop.jpg"><IMG SRC="Cudapics1/IMG_0278-crop-t.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=103 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A>                  <P><A HREF="Cudapics3/P7280013.JPG"><IMG SRC="Cudapics3/P7280013-t.jpg" WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Cuda-Flap model with "Tri-Hedral" Wing.<BR>         16" flat center section, 3.75" dihedral at tips</P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </B></FONT></P></CENTER><P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%">   <TR BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="60%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuselage         Modifications -         </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>Small         changes</B></FONT></P>                  <UL>            <LI><B>Reinforce the fuselage sides</B> - The 1/16" balsa            sides are somewhat weak. After doing the rough assembly,            glue 1/64" plywood or .010" G10/Waferglass to the sides.            Or, add the balsa to the bottom of the fusealge, sand it            curved, then add some 3/4 oz. fiberglass.</LI>                        <LI><B>Lengthen the forward fuselage</B> - Some Cudas            have needed noseweight due to a mix of the tail being a            bit heavy, pus more recently the advent of even lighter            radio gear which is mounted in front of the CG. To            lengthen the forward fuselage, you would need to either            draw up and cut out a totally new set of sides, or work            up some extension pieces to glue to the existing sides.            Also use the above tip to reinforce the fuselage            sides.</LI>                        <LI><B>Replace the Tailboom</B> - the origina was            somewhat heavy, made of fiberglass. I have used Avia            G-Force Tapered Graphite boom. It is carried by the            <A HREF="http://www.intothewind.com/shop/Repair_and_Kitemaking/G-Force_Carbon/G-Force_Ultralight_.345-.232_x_40_">"Into            The Wind" Kite company.</A> I suggest the 32.5" models            ultra-light, but not the Skinny ultra-light as that seems            too thin. Take note that if you are using the laser-cut            parts, that the original holes may not match the diameter            of the boom. Most likely the hole will be too big. If so,            wrap masking tape around the boom to build up the            thickness, and get the fit just right in dry-fit testing.            Later, you can use thin CA to glue the boom in            place.</LI>                        <LI><B>T" Tail </B>- Unless you have done V-tails before,            use the "T" Tail option.</LI>         </UL>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="40%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P><A HREF="Cudapics1/IMG_0278-crop.jpg"><IMG SRC="Cudapics1/IMG_0278-crop-t.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=103 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         "T" Tail Option on Jim Filler's Cuda</P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="60%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuselage         Modifications -         </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>Big         changes</B></FONT></P>                  <UL>            <LI><B>Home-Made Balsa Pod</B> - Redesign the pod            entirely.

On the Cuda, the wing            is supposed to be at zero degrees angle of attack            (parallel) to the boom. If you make a Saddle mount, you            will need to make it so the wing will be parallel to the            boom. If you glue the wing on, you will either have to            make a saddle, or cut and sand a notch in the bottom of            the boom then add fiberglass cloth to reinforce the            bottom of the wing that was notched out. As seen in the            third example below, if you just glued the mostly flat            part of the wing to the boom, it would have an angle of            attack of 1.8 degrees, which would cause it to pitch up            very badly.</LI>         </UL>                  <CENTER><A HREF="../glidergraphics/WingSaddle.gif"><IMG SRC="../glidergraphics/WingSaddle-t.gif" WIDTH=339 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="40%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=6 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=12>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="20%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../S8/Raven9/DSC_1910.jpg"><IMG SRC="../S8/Raven9/DSC_1910-t.jpg" WIDTH=185 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Bob Parks' <A HREF="http://web.mac.com/parky/RavenNine/Welcome.html">Raven-9                  </A>Servos</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="20%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../S8/Raven9/DSC_1918.jpg"><IMG SRC="../S8/Raven9/DSC_1918-t.jpg" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Wing Mount Saddle for <A HREF="http://web.mac.com/parky/RavenNine/Welcome.html">Raven-9</A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=6 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=12>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="20%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Cudapics1/IMG_0347-crop.jpg"><IMG SRC="Cudapics1/IMG_0347-crop-t.jpg" WIDTH=178 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Chad Ring's Light Cuda</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="20%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Cudapics4/N-50-IMG_0264.jpg"><IMG SRC="Cudapics4/N-50-IMG_0264-t.jpg" WIDTH=187 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Ryan Woebkenberg's <A HREF="CudaFlap.htm">Cuda                  Ray</A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><P><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=6 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=12>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><A HREF="Cudapics1/IMG_0347.jpg"><IMG SRC="Cudapics1/IMG_0347-t.jpg" WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Chad Ring's Light Cuda</CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><A HREF="Cudapics4/CudaRayRadioPod3.JPG"><IMG SRC="Cudapics4/CudaRayRadioPod3-t.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=193 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Ryan Woebkenberg's <A HREF="CudaFlap.htm">Cuda         Ray</A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER>.<A HREF="Cudapics3/P7280013.JPG"><IMG SRC="Cudapics3/P7280013-t.jpg" WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         George's <A HREF="CudaFlap.htm">Cuda-Flap</A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></P><P><IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=bottom></P></CENTER><P></P></BODY></HTML>
