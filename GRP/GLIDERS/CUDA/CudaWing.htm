A few people have had their wings fail on boost, and         almost always it has involved models where the 1/32" skins         were sanded thinner, and/or they forgot to add the         fiberglass reinforcing cloth inside to act like a spar.         </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">When you have the 1/32 balsa wing skins         glue together and cut out, mark off the locations (inside         the skins) for the fiberglass "Spar", and for the fiberglass         to be applied to the trailing edge to strengthen it. Also         use a magic marker to color the last 1/2" of the trailing         edge area. This is so that much later, when the trailing         edge is sanded, you will be able to see your         progress.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the photo are right, I was preparing         for a unique "Cuda-Flap" model, I cut out a slot for a         shaped balsa insert to go into the foam core, to act as a         rear spar and reinforcement when I later cut out the flap. I         only mention this to explain why the photo at right is a bit         unique, a normal Cuda wing would not have that. The "R" on         the core means that is the core for the right wing, top side         up. The "RB" on the balsa skin means it is the Right Bottom         wingskin.</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=400>         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><A HREF="Cuda-Flap/P1010013-a.jpg"><IMG SRC="Cuda-Flap/P1010013-a-t.jpg" WIDTH=183 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="60%">         <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the next photo, the laminating epoxy         has been applied to the upper and lower skins, which are         hinged using making tape, as per the instruction manual. The         right bottom skin now is under the core, while the upper         right skin is hinged to it (using masking tape as per the         instruction manual). Also for this unique wing, epoxy also         was applied to the balsa insert at the flap hinge         line.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The pinkish color is due to some red dye         added on purpose to visualize the epoxy coverage. The epoxy         was squeegeed on, then a lot of it squeegeed off, leaving a         "sheen". Since this wing was going to be weakened by the         flap cut-out, the normal fiberglass cloth "spar" was         replaced by .003" thick graphite strip (which was applied to         both Top and Bottom skins). It does not show up in the         photos, but there was also epoxy squeegeed onto the. 003"         graphite strip, as it has to be fully bonded top and bottom         to the skins and foam core.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">DO NOT FORGET to add the fiberglass         "spar" to the top and bottom wing skins! Also, remember to         apply the trailing edge fiberglass cloth too. But that only         had to be applied to one of the skins, since after folding         over the sandwich will be trailing edge upper skin,         fiberglass, and trailing edge lower skin.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This particular wing also had some extra         fiberglass cloth added near the bolt hole area, as well as         near the skin's leading edge, and all of the flap area - out         to the marking for the future Tri-Hedral break. Those are         visible as being slightly darker, deeper pin, than the         other. I mainly point this out in case some built a         non-stock Cuda, that is really lightweight, you may want to         add some extra reinforcement inside your wing to be sure it         does not shred from a much faster boost speed than Cuda was         designed and tested to.</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=400>         <CENTER><A HREF="Cuda-Flap/CudaLayup.jpg"><IMG SRC="Cuda-Flap/CudaLayup-t.jpg" WIDTH=354 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">      <TD WIDTH="60%">         <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is possible to use weights to compress         the cores together, as shown in the manual. But do not skimp         on the weight, note the manual mentions using 200 to 300         pounds! A Vac-bagging system is highly recommended. Whatever         you do, MAKE SURE that once you have the skins and core         together, laid correctly into the foam beds, that you use         some masking tape to help keep everything aligned. Using         weights, it is certainly possible for the epoxy to act like         grease, to let one of the skins slide to one side,         especially if the weights are not balanced out well. If that         happened, the whole wing panel would be ruined</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">At right is a photo model by Alex         Seltsikas when he built his Cuda.

The Bag Clip allows one end of the         "bag" to be folded over with the Bag Clip's round core, with         the "C" cross section blue clip snapped in place to seal off         the bag.
