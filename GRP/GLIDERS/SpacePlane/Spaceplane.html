That was the Astron Space Plane,         Kit K-03, in 1961.

Finally settled on the         Astron Space Plane. Planned to also fly that in the         Imagination Celebration at NARAM.</P>                  <P>Of course I wanted it to be R/C, as I had done with the         SkyDart 2X project. For this one, I decided to make a very         simple easy 2X prototype, and see how it flew. If I liked         how it flew, then I might be able to justify making a larger         one. The 2X scale made the wingspan about 17".</P>                  <P>Note that <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">all photos on this page         are thumbnails</FONT>, click on them to see larger         images.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099"><B>Astron         Space Plane 2X</B></FONT>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099">Built         May, 2008</FONT>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>                  <P>The 2X size was good for a model that could fly on just a         C6 engine. It is not a dead-on scale model, a few things         were tweaked. A BT-55 would be close to 2X size, but the         ultra micro servos required having the tube just a little         bit larger. So, I used some Quest 35mm tubing. I had some         left over from the NARAM-48 Quest Kitbash, the tubing was         red and the nose cone was red, so that was a nice match.</P>                  <P>The servos were small enough to glue bottom-to-bottom,         with their output shafts sticking out the side of the 35mm         tubing. To get the servos in, first I had to make the proper         size holes in the tubing for the output shafts to stick out         thru, then squeezed the tube into an oval so the servos         could be slid into place. You can see in the middle photo         below how the left side servo output arm sticks out,         connected to a pushrod that goes to the left elevon.</P>                  <P>The wing was simply 1/8" balsa. The elevons also 1/8",         but from a bit stiffer and heavier piece of balsa. Also, the         whole elevons were covered with red Monokote to stiffen them         against twisting. The Monokote was also used as a hinge.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=180>         <CENTER><A HREF="GeorgeVern.jpg"><IMG SRC="GeorgeVern-tb.jpg" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=168 ALIGN=top></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">Vern Estes (right )<BR>         &amp; George at NARAM-50.<BR>         Vern is holding a<BR>         Golden Scout kit.<BR>         Photo by Tom Beach</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="IMG_0757.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_0757-tb.jpg" WIDTH=137 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Ont the pad, using 3/16"                  rod</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="40%">         <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_0747.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_0747-tb.jpg" WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Space Plane 2X                  model</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_0759.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_0759-tb.jpg" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Shortly before the first                  flight</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="40%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=180>         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>The rudder tips were made in two parts so that the grain         could run the optimum way to prevent breakage, and a strip         of spruce added to the trailing edge of each rudder to         strengthen it.</P>                  <P>A micro whip antenna was used internally, with a Berg         Stamp receiver. For power, a 2 cell 90mAh 7.4V Li-Poly         battery pack running off of a 5 volt regulator.</P>                  <P>Each servo drives an elevon directly. The transmitter         does electronic mixing so that pitch and roll (elevator and         aileron) control is commanded to the servos to drive the         elevons.</P>                  <P>The 2X model was flown at the <A HREF="http://birminghamrocketboys.com/BRBGallery/main.php?g2_itemId=31735">BRB         May launch</A>. First flights were on B6-2 engines. I         figured it would be too twitchy to try to control on boost         like most other R/C RBG's, so I gave it full left aileron at         launch to make it roll on boost. However, it still pitched         lot at liftoff. I used up a number of B6's dialing in the         correct amount of elevator trim for boost, and increasing         the aileron throw for boost to make it roll more. Finally         got it worked out, and went to C6 power.</P>                  <P>It turned out to behave VERY nicely during glide. R/C         control of it was very easy, and the response to the R/C         control was very good. It flew so well that it should make a         nice addition to the "demo fleet" when we go do rocket         flight demos at schoolyards that are too small to risk some         of the larger models we'd like to.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=180>         <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=200>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099"><B>AstronSpace Plane 4X</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099">Built June,2008</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=180>         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>The 2X flew so well, that confirmed the idea of making an         even larger one for NARAM. I wanted it to be able to boost         on a G12 reload. After working out some numbers and weighing         some components, I settled on a 4X model. With a span of         nearly 34", and using a BT-80 body tube. Similar layout as         with the 2X model, just twice as big.</P>                  <P>The wings were solid 1/4" balsa. I figured this one         needed to look "pretty", so I decided to use Towerkote on         the whole wings rather an leave them bare balsa. When I         ironed on the Towerkote on the first side of the left wing,         the wing got warped, badly. I worried for awhile the warp         might not go away. But after covering the other side, I was         able to get it all flat again.</P>                  <P>The rudder tips were 1/8" balsa. With some basswood         strips laminated to the full length of the lower rudder's         leading edge curving to bottom surface. That was for ding         resistance, as well as spruce glued to the trailing         edge.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=180>         <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=200>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_1445.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_1445-tb.jpg" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">2X and 4X models on                  pads</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="40%">         <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_1349.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_1349-tb.jpg" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  2X and 4X models</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_1358.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_1358-tb.jpg" WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Ready for the first flight of the                  4X</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="40%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=180>         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>For R/C gear, a pair of micro servos with plenty of         torque to handle this model. A Hitec 555 receiver, and 140         mAh Li-poly 7.4 Pack plus 5V regulator. For the antenna, I         replaced the last 36" of the 555 receiver antenna with .020"         music wire, and let that trail down from the front , down         inside the body and out the back ,trailing about a foot         behind the model.</P>                  <P>to make it more practical to ship, the body tube is in         two parts, with a tube coupler. To fit into the box I found         for it, I had to have the joint a few inches behind the         start of the wing, so there is a triangular part of the         front edge of the wing glued to the removable nose         section.</P>                  <P>With the engine located pretty close to the glide CG,         there was no need to compensate for propellant mass burnoff,         such as had to be done with the X-1 model (which used a         water ballast tank in the nose). That was one of the other         things that the 2X model had proven, even when the 2X model         ejected out its engine. For the 4X, the 32mm reload casing         would stay onboard.</P>                  <P>For the launch rod, simply a spare .505" diameter         fiberglass tube as used for tower rails. For a launch lug,         BT-5 was too tight of a fit, so a piece of 14mm tubing was         used. The 14mm tubing was a bit wimpy, so it was given a few         wraps of 3/4 oz. fiberglass cloth and saturated with some         laminating epoxy to make it plenty sturdy.</P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=180>         <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=200>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="IMG_0438.jpg"><IMG SRC="IMG_0438-tb.jpg" WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Gliding along</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_0442-crop.jpg"><IMG SRC="IMG_0442-crop-tb.jpg" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Glide photos by Blake                  Driskill</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=300>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_0443.jpg"><IMG SRC="IMG_0443-tb.jpg" WIDTH=237 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Landing</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=180>         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>The model was ready for the <A HREF="http://birminghamrocketboys.com/BRBGallery/main.php?g2_itemId=32497">June         BRB launch</A>. Since it was pretty large and sort of heavy,         I figured it out not be twitchy on boost, so I did not try         to roll it. It took off and just boosted almost like it was         on rails. Zero roll, and just a hair of a pitch-down. Was so         easy to correct the boost for. That first flight was on an         F13, in case the boost was poor it would burn out in 3.5         seconds rather than last for 8 seconds on a G12. But that         first test went so well, I flew it several more times that         day. The glide handling was even better than for the 2X         model. It reminded me of the Zagi Flying Wing that I had         converted to Rocket Power, not quite as good of glide but         the R/C handling was so good (the dihedral plus leading edge         sweepback helps make the roll response very forgiving). Then         I put it away to ship to NARAM-50.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=180>         <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=200>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099"><B>NARAM-50 andORR-3</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099">Late July,2008</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=180>         <CENTER><A HREF="GeorgeVern.jpg"><IMG SRC="GeorgeVern-tb.jpg" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=168 ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">Photo by Tom Beach</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="60%">         <P>At NARAM-50, I was fortunate to get the kind of photo I         wanted - Vern Estes posing with the 4X model and myself.         Vern was holding one of the "Golden Scout" models flown for         the 50th anniversary. Thanks to Tom Beach for the photos.         Veneer and Gleda really liked seeing the 2X and 4X         models.</P>                  <P>On Saturday morning at 11 AM, there was a special launch         of old models. I flew the 2X, then after landing changed the         model memory in the transmitter and flew the 4X. It took off         nicely, but started to roll a little left. I gave right         aileron input but it kept rolling left, even more. I was         standing directly under it, as it rolled I rotated myself         wit it to keep oriented with it, but it kept rolling and         rolling. And this was on a G12, with an 8 second burn. The         good thing that it was still boosting "up", just in a         climbing spiral. A lot of people thought I was doing that on         purpose. I did not understand how I could have that much         trouble trying to stop the roll. I was almost dizzy when it         finally burned out, and I could stop spinning with it. I put         it into a glide. I tried to make it turn left.... and it         turned to the right. Oh. For some reason, the roll control         was backwards, so when it started left, and I gave right, I         actually was giving it a lot more left, making it roll more         and more left. Good thing it is so stable that it glides         free-flight just fine, like it was designed to in 1961. So I         did not try to steer it around for a landing close by, I did         the minimum to keep it in the general area and let it land         safely a few hundred feet away.</P>                  <P>Later I realized what went wrong. When I had switched         from the 2X model's memory in the transmitter to the 4X         model's memory, I had forgotten to click "OK" to actually         make the transmitter switch from the 2X to the 4X. And the         aileron control is reversed on the 2X compared to the 4X.         OK, better it was that which was reversed rather than         elevator being reversed, that would have been a         disaster.</P>                  <P>On Sunday, the Imagination Celebration was held. I flew         the 4X two more times.. On Friday, when Scale was flown, we         did not have a scale entry so it was a "free day". So, I         flew the 4X four more times that day.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=180>         <CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="VernGeorgeSpaceplane.jpg"><IMG SRC="VernGeorgeSpaceplane-tb.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         With Vern at the pad<FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         Photo by Tom Beach</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><A HREF="Spaceplane.jpg"><IMG SRC="Spaceplane-tb.jpg" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Boost - Vern at far left, with Jay Marsh</CENTER>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_0359.JPG"><IMG SRC="IMG_0359-tb.jpg" WIDTH=114 HEIGHT=180 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">Imagination Celebration<BR>         Note servo arm, pushrod, and Control Horn</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=20>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/GRP-1.jpg" WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=59 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=60>         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><A NAME=top></A><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../Glider.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to Gliders</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
