We had theorized that the best         way to go would not be with some exotic fabrication methods.         Especially since the rules or interpretations of what was         and was not allowed were not specific enough to trust from         one month to the next, to the day the event was actually         flown. Instead, we figured that the best way would be to go         with conventional construction methods, with a very careful         choice of engine thrust profiles. The first idea was to use         two F10's (one on F10 and two E6's). But at the time F10's         were not Contest certified. The next best option was to use         something like a G12 reload (93 n-sec) and two E7 reloads         (30 N-sec). But since the G12 reload did not have a delay         and ejection charge, a model would have to be a bit more         complicated, with some type of electronic ejection. That was         somewhat more complex to get into at the time, as our team         had a Launch Crue Regional coming up in November, so simpler         approaches were attempted first, to get some real flying         experience to compare with what we expected.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>First         Test - Oct 21, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near         Childersburg, Alabama</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Model used nearly all BT-80, plus a BT-60 upper section.

It continued to bend and veer         more and more to one side, finally ripping apart. We knew         that a G40 would not be ideal for the event but were         surprised that a mostly BT-80 model was not strong enough.         <IMG SRC="../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Second and Third Model Tests -         November, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launch Crue Regional         Holland, Indiana</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Ryan Woebkenberg flew a short BT-60 model that was highly         reinforced, on a G40.

It flew great. Boosted         vertically, with very little weathercocking at all, very         notable for an 8 second burn. Here is a <A HREF="../video/VidFiles/G-Superroc-Test-March-2007.mov">Video         of the G Superroc Test Flight</A>. Take note that the delay         on the F10 (an OLD F10) was very long, the model went into a         "backslider" type of glide for a few seconds before         ejection.</P>                  <P>That test confirmed what we had theorized back in August         2006 when the event was announced for NARAM-46.

Also, one of the two F10's had a cato. We did         not know whether the cato caused the shred or if the shred         was before the cato. We were given a reflight. So, we went         back to the prototype built in March, using two E6's and one         F10 (modle #4). However, we were shaken by the shred of the         two F10 model, as structurally both were the same. So, we         removed the original tube joiners and replaced them with         longer tube joiners to make the model stiffer, and also a         bit heaver which reduced the velocity at cost of altitude.         We had other backup models, but this was the only model left         that could use the "160 N-sec G20" engine combination (in         this case, one F10 and two E6's).</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Gsuper/DSCN0998.jpg"><IMG SRC="Gsuper/DSCN0998-tb.JPG" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=125 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Gsuper/DSCN0022.jpg"><IMG SRC="Gsuper/DSCN0022-tb.JPG" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=125 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Gsuper/IMG_4378.JPG"><IMG SRC="Gsuper/IMG_4378-tb.JPG" WIDTH=93 HEIGHT=125 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Gsuper/DSCN0036.jpg"><IMG SRC="Gsuper/DSCN0036-tb.JPG" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=93 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Gsuper/DSCN0033.JPG"><IMG SRC="Gsuper/DSCN0033-tb.JPG" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=93 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER>2nd Flight</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER>3rd (winning) Flight</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER>Terrill and Ed after<BR>                  the last flight.</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER>Terrill, George, &amp; Ed</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER>The whole winning model</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          The reflight using the March model flew great. But, despite         four trackers, only one saw it, so the flight was a lost         track. So officially under the rules, we still got to do         flight one over. But time was getting tight, we might not         have had time to fly two more times, so the third flight of         the day was critical. Fortunately, it was tracked, and went         on to easily win Team Division.</P>                  <P>So, the engine power we theorized a year before proved         out and won. So, all the time and effort we put into it was         worth it. Plus, the R&amp;D that had been done involving         preparing for the event as useful in becoming a NARAM         R&amp;D project as well. Below is a summary from the report,         a link for downloading the whole report as a PDF file.</P>                  <P>The win in G Superroc, plus second in R&amp;D, helped us         win the NARAM Champion Team Trophy, and helped assure that         nobody passed us so that we also won the Team National         Championship for the 2006-2007 season.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></P>                  <P><B>Report Summary:</B></P>                  <P>Our objective was to develop a highly competitive G         Superroc model, without using composite fabrication, special         construction, or special design tricks.</P>                  <P>We realized that winning Superroc models are almost         always maximum length, so a highly competitive G class model         probably needed to be maximum length, at 450 CM (or 14.76         feet) tall.</P>                  <P>We first built and flew a maximum length G Superroc, and         quickly found out some of the problems associated with         building and fly a nearly 15 foot tall rocket powered by a G         engine. When that model failed, we had to work up two         less-than ideal models to compete with at a Novembers         regionalcontest, and get some more practical in-the-field         experience at an actual contest.</P>                  <P>Having obtained more experience, we set about to build a         highly competitive model, of maximum length, which would         require less structural strength than the other models that         were being flown. We realized that the optimum engine choice         seemed to be a cluster of long burn low thrust engines,         either two F10's or one F10 and two E6's. Those choices also         are rated at 160 N-sec, giving full total impulse for flying         the event. For practical purposes, like using a 160 N-sec         "G20" engine.</P>                  <P>By using one of those two choices, the model would fly         slower and have less structural flight loads than with any         other viable G engine choice. That is the key to obtaining         good flight performance out of paper/cardboard G Superrocs,         reducing the flight loads so they do not have to be as         strong as with other engines in the 80.01 to 160 N-sec         class.</P>                  <P>An all-BT-60 model of 450 CM was built and tested,         successfully flying on an F10 and two E6's.</P>                  <P>Refinements were made to that design, to reduce drag of         the lower section with the engines and fins.</P>                  <P>In addition to flight testing, some Rocksim simulations         were run, based on some of the test models, to evaluate and         compare other engine choices which had been considered.         Those simulations show that higher thrust engines produce         lower altitudes and often significantly higher flight loads         than two F10's or one F10 and two E6's. Those simulations         helped to confirm our conclusions.</P>                  <P>We feel that we have a competitive design approach to use         at NARAM-49.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><B>Click here for a </B><A HREF="Gsuper/G_SuperRoc_RandD.pdf"><B>PDF         Copy of the full G Superroc Report</B></A><B>.
