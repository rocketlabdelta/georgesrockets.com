This model         is a relatively easy to build balsa model which flies         somewhat similarly to the circular cardstock Flying Saucer         introduced by Centuri in 1977 and also in plastic from by         Estes years later.</P>                  <P>The model is primarily built from 3/32" balsa. Non-wood         parts required are one 2" length of 18mm tube for the engine         mount, an engine block, and a launch lug for flying off 1/8"         launch rods.</P>                  <P>The plan shows full size templates for the struts and         spin tab joint reinforcements, photocopy them so as not to         cut into the magazine to use them. Due to space limitations         the triangular body side and spin tab shapes are shown 1/2         size, but those are easy to draw out. Cut out all parts,         being careful that the wood grain runs in the right         direction.</P>                  <P>Prepare the wood parts by sanding the leading and         trailing edges of the struts, the leading edges of the side         plates for the triangular body, as well as the trailing         edges of the spin tabs. Sand the 45 degree diagonal edges of         the side plates to a bevel of about 45 degrees, so the         joints will match up well when the three side plates are         glued together.</P>                  <P>Finish: If you want to have a smooth finish on the model,         it needs to be done before assembly as most of the balsa         surfaces cannot be easily reached by sandpaper after         assembly. A coat or two of sanding sealer is all that's         needed for a somewhat reasonable finish. However, the         prototype had no sealer, it was sanded smooth then after         assembly sprayed flat white for an undercoat and fluorescent         orange for the final color.</P>                  <P>Assembly: Use tape to hold the edges of the side plates         together, to create the triangular body. The tape should go         across the top of the corners, and the placement adjusted so         that the three side plates are held aligned in the proper         position for gluing. Use thin Cyanoacrylate glue (CA) along         the inside of the corners (opposite of the side with the         tape) to tack-glue the side plates together. After the CA         has cured, remove the tape, careful not to pop the         tack-glued joints loose. Than use more CA along the inside         of the joints for a solid bond. Be careful not to use so         much CA that it runs. After the CA is cured, use sandpaper         to round off the sharp outer corners of the joints.</P>                  <P>Use the guide in the plan to mark onto the engine tube         the location for the 3 struts. Use a door jamb as a guide to         redraw those marks into parallel lines for the strut         roots.</P>                  <P>Insert a standard size 18mm engine into the engine tube,         using tape for a friction fit so the engine top is flush         with the top of the engine tube. This should leave exactly         3/4 of the engine protruding down from the tube. Place this         on a flat surface. Hold one of the struts in position         alongside the motor tube, with the trailing edge of the         strut root even with the bottom of the motor tube. The tip         of the strut should just barely touch the building surface,         as the strut has 3/4" sweepback. Apply a little CA to         tack-glue the strut into place on the engine tube, being         careful not to let the CA run to accidentally glue the         engine into the tube. Repeat with the other two struts.         Remove the engine. Since the struts may not be exactly 120         degrees apart, lay the strut/tube assembly upside down into         the triangular body assembly (also inverted). With the         strut/tube assembly centered, carefully pry the struts if         necessary to get them seated into the inner corners of the         triangular body. Then apply CA for the root edges of the         struts, along the tube, to permanently glue the struts to         the tube (do not glue to the triangular body yet).</P>                  <P>Insert the engine back into the engine mount tube,         leaving it hanging out by about 1.5", with a slip-fit that         is not too tight or too loose. Set the strut/mount assembly         onto a flat surface, with protruding engine holding the         assembly above the work surface. Carefully slip the         triangular body down over the strut tips, keeping it         centered. Press so that the engine tube/strut assembly also         slides down the engine, until the triangular body touches         the flat surface. If you have done this right, the engine         bottom is still flat to the work surface, assuring the         engine tube is properly aligned. If not, repeat the process         to get it right. When you're sure it is aligned, apply some         drops of CA to the strut tips to tack glue them to the inner         corner joints of the triangular body. After curing, lift off         the model from the surface and apply more CA to make the         strut tip to body joints permanent.</P>                  <P>To help even out any errors in alignment, as well as add         some extra flair to the flying, the model uses spin tabs         which also look like landing pads (OK, sort of...). Making         sure the spin tab grain is in the correct direction, glue         the spin tab root directly to the trailing edge of the side         plate, so that the tab is the same angle as the side plate.         Make sure all three tabs are located to the same corners in         order to produce the desired spin. The prototype had a         problem with spin tabs getting broken in transport, so the         plan shows a 1/2" wide reinforcement strip. The         reinforcement can be 1/32" plywood, or 1/16 to 3/32" balsa.         Glue the reinforcement strip to the underside, half of it         across the spin tab root and half across the side plate, as         shown in the bottom view.</P>                  <P>Remove the engine from the tube, and glue in an engine         block (or 1/8" tall piece of burned out casing acting as an         engine block). Glue a launch lug to the engine tube, at the         root of one of the struts.</P>                  <P>The model is now complete, other than adding a final         finish. Color as desired</P>                  <P>Intended engine power is B6-0 and C6-0. B6-2 or C6-3         engines are not recommended due to the potential to eject         too close to the ground. Tape the motor in for a friction         fit.</P>                  <P>When flown the model will climb to about 100 feet on a C6         motor, spinning slowly. When the motor burns out, the model         will come to a stop almost immediately, then flip over and         descend while rotating. Due to the very high drag, the model         will land relatively softly. With no recovery system to         prep, reflights go fast.....until you run out of         engines!<BR>         </P>      </TD>      <TD NOWRAP WIDTH=10 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="15%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica">&nbsp;</FONT><A HREF="#top">Back toTop</A></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#99CCFF" WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <P><A HREF="../../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../gcghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>George's         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../NARshuttle/shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         Shuttle Model AOL Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../RBGliders/rbghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>RBGliders         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
