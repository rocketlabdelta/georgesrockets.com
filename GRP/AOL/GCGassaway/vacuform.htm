In some cases, the         best answer would be to vacuum form parts if you had the         means to do so. Now you can, with a crude homemade forming         device that can be built in one night for as little as $20,         depending on materials. It does require two appliances most         people have, an oven and a vacuum cleaner. Due to the use of         an oven for heating the plastic and the risk of fire if the         oven is left unattended, this is recommended only for adult         modelers or for use under adult supervision.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Building the Vacuum Box: The Vacuum         Box's purpose is to serve as a good interface between the         plastic held in the holder frame and the vacuum from the         vacuum cleaner. Therefore, the vacuum box can be just about         any size and can be built from many different materials as         long as certain criteria are met. I made the vacuum box from         fiberboard, which is fairly cheap but is not easy to cut.         Plastic is a good material to make most of the box from, as         long as the top of the box is not plastic. The top needs to         be some sort of heat resistant sturdy material that will not         sag from the combined effects of the hot plastic in the         frame and the vacuum itself. The vacuum box needs to have         some supports under the top surface to keep the top surface         from sagging while forming, the supports not interfering         with the vacuum to any of the holes in the top of the box.         The box must be airtight, except for the holes in the top         surface and the side connection to the vacuum hose (the side         connection can simply be a short piece of BT-55 or other         tube that fits the hose). The top of the box can be made of         pre-drilled perfboard from an electronics store (easy but         expensive), or fiberboard/hardboard/plywood with holes you         drill yourself (cheap but takes time). Your biggest decision         will be in choosing what size to make the vacuum box, as it         will determine the maximum size plastic you will be able to         form. I chose to make a vacuum box two inches deep with top         dimensions of 12" by 18" so that it could handle the largest         plastic/frame combination that could fit into the oven,         although so far the largest size frame used has been one 13"         by 12" to hold a 12" by 11" sheet of plastic. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Building the Holder Frame: The         frame holds the plastic during heating and forming. There         are different materials to use for the frame. Metal would be         best for heat resistance, and modelers with the equipment         and skills to do metal working may want to make the frame         from metal. The frames can be made from 1/4" hardboard (such         as Masonite) and cut out, or they can be constructed from         materials such as spruce. I have made frames out of 1/8"         thick spruce, each top and bottom frame using eight pieces         (four atop four others, with the joints overlapping). An         upper frame and lower frame is required, the plastic will be         held between them. Holes will need to be drilled in equally         spaced locations for the bolts and nuts which hold the         frames together. It is best to tape the frames together so         that the holes will be aligned properly, and make a mark on         each frame to indicate how to align them once they have been         apart. </FONT></P>                  <CENTER>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="GENERAL/vac/Vacuform1.GIF" WIDTH=331 HEIGHT=233 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The best bolts to use are 6-32 with         wing nuts to hold the frames together; the wing nuts make         installing and removing the plastic much easier. Use         cyanoacrylate type glue to permanently bond most of the         bolts to the bottom frame, upside down with the threads         sticking up. Do not glue bolts in place along one side         however, so that they can be temporarily slipped out of         place. This will allow you to more easily slide out leftover         scrap plastic and slide in a new sheet from the side the         bolts are removed from (this way, you don't have to remove         and replace all those wingnuts every time you form a part).         Since the heads of the bolts will protrude down from the         bottom frame, add some strips of spruce along the bottom         frame so that the bottom frame will meet flush with the top         of the vacuum box for a fairly airtight seal.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">You will most likely find a need to         make several different size frames to hold different sizes         of plastic, depending on how large or how small the part to         be formed is. Plastic sheets 4"x 4" can handle small nose         cones (&lt;1" dia and &lt;2.5" long) and 6"x 6" plastic         sheets for larger cones up to egg capsule halves. Some frame         sizes will be dependent on the source for the plastic.         Evergreen Scale Models plastic sheets are commonly 6" x         10.5", so a special size frame is needed to hold Evergreen         plastic (for economy, it is good to make a smaller frame to         hold a half sheet too, which is 6"x 5.25"). Once the size of         the plastic sheet has been determined, plan out the size of         the frame so that the bolts of the frame will be just         outside the edges of the plastic sheet. For example, for a         6"x 6" sheet of plastic, the frame should be about 7"x 7"         with 1/2" frame overlap beyond all edges of the plastic.         There should also be about 1/2" of the frame gripping the         plastic sheet. This would mean the frame would measure 7"x         7" on the outside and 5"x 5" on the inside, the frame itself         having a one inch "wall thickness" all around. See figure         #2.</FONT></P>                  <CENTER>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="GENERAL/vac/Vacuform2.GIF" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=189 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Other items: A holder needs to be         made to hold the plastic and frame above the oven rack. This         can be any heatproof material that can hold the frame 3-4"         off of the rack. Sheet metal can be bent into a large "U"         shape to hold the frame.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The vacuum box has holes all over         the top, but you may want to use a frame smaller than the         area with the holes. To effectively cut off a vacuum leak         through those holes outside of the frame area, cut out a         mask from poster paper. The rectangular hole in the mask         should be about 1-2" smaller than the frame inside         dimensions, to allow a little leeway if the frame is not         centered exactly during forming. The outside mask dimensions         should be about the same as the top of the box, or at         minimum it should be enough to cover the outermost holes in         the vacuum box top. The mask can be secured by tape along         the edges. Make enough masks to handle the different frame         sizes. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Molds: Molds can be made from         several materials, such as balsa, hardwood, metal, resin,         and plastic (most any material which can adequately         withstand the heat and vacuum). It is even possible to use         plastic model parts as molds as long as the hollow plastic         is filled inside with something such as plaster and the part         formed over it is not from very thick plastic (thick plastic         will tend to transfer some of its heat to the plastic mold         so much as to disfigure it or cause it to sag). Other hollow         molds should likewise be filled, as the vacuum force can         cause the mold to sag or collapse.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The mold should have a flat bottom         and not have any undercut. No undercut means that the sides         of the mold must not taper back inwards once past the         maximum width, otherwise the part cannot be removed from the         mold. This is not a problem with most nose cone shapes since         at worst the sides become parallel. For a nose cone mold,         make it a bit longer than where it will be trimmed for the         shoulder. There will be a limitation as to how tall a nose         cone can be and still have the plastic draw down properly         around the mold. Four to five inches will be about the         maximum height the plastic will draw with this homemade         set-up, depending on the exact shape being formed (a wide         cone like an Apollo capsule or SRB nose will draw well,         while a long 3:1 type ogive may be difficult). Such high         draw parts will also need large sheets of plastic, such as         an 11"x 12" sheet. Experience will give you a better idea         what shapes and sizes are likely to form properly or         not.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Most modelers would tend to use         molds made from wood, typically balsa or some hardwood.         Balsa is easiest for modelers to turn, but is not as robust         as turning one form hardwood ( remember, the mold isn't         going to fly, so it doesn't matter what it weighs. . . ).         The mold needs to have a good heatproof finish. The best         finish is to use finishing resin. If you use resin, pay         attention to the warnings about eye protection from the         hardener, avoiding skin contact, and its use in a well         ventilated place. A dope, primer, or similar type finish is         no good, as the hot plastic will cause it to bubble. Besides         the resin providing a smooth finish which the formed part         will duplicate, it will be easier to remove the part from a         smooth mold than a rough mold. Still, some non-tapered         shapes may be difficult to remove from the mold. This         sticking can be reduced by dusting the mold with talcum         powder as a lubricant. Do not use any mold release waxes or         liquid type lubricants, as they will tend to bubble from the         heat.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Plastics: There are many different         plastics which can be used for vacuum forming, but use only         those that are recommended for such use. Such acceptable         plastics are styrene, A.B.S., butyrate, vinyl, and acetate.         There are others, check with a local plastics supply house         for the best type for your purpose for a reasonable price.         Plastic sheets can be bought in large sizes up to 4'x 8', at         a cost per square foot tremendously cheaper than the hobby         store variety. However, sometimes the only way to get a         certain thickness is to get a few small sheets of hobby         plastic as plastic dealers do not have all thicknesses. I         found a sign shop which uses and sells plastic sheets         offering 2'x 3' styrene .06 plastic for $2.50, with lower         prices for thinner plastic. It isn't a great grade of         styrene, but it works for most parts made from it. So, you         can shop around for a good price. The thickness of plastic         will mostly be determined by just what size the part to be         formed is and what tradeoffs in strength, stiffness, and         mass you can live with. Most big noses will be strong enough         with .06 plastic, an egg capsule made from .06" plastic is         plenty strong for anything short a high speed crash. Some         BT-50 or smaller noses may be better if made from .04         plastic. Special non-nose cone parts which need to reproduce         mold detail or have minimum weight could use very thin         plastic .01-.02" thick if the strength is adequate for the         application. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Forming: (safety note- Due to the         fumes released by the hot plastic, set up a fan and open a         window to help ventilation). Choose the plastic to use and         mount it in the holder frame. Turn on the oven and set it         for about 250-300 degrees for styrene (other plastics may         take less heat or more heat). As the oven is heating up, set         up the vacuum box and connect it to the vacuum hose. The         vacuum box should be as close as possible to the oven, as         the plastic loses heat within seconds. Place the mold in the         center of the window of the mask. In some cases, it may be         necessary to make a small pedestal to hold the mold about         1/4-1/2" above the vacuum box so that the plastic will form         completely around the lower portions of the mold. Dust the         mold with some talcum powder, which will act to help the         formed part slip out of the mold.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When the oven has heated up, place         the frame holder on the oven rack and place the frame with         the plastic on the holder. The plastic must be watched         continuously to see when it is hot and soft enough for         forming. Some thin plastic can be ready in less than 60         seconds, thicker plastic can take 2-3 minutes. Styrene tends         to sag a good deal as it becomes hot and soft enough to         form, so you can watch for the sag. Other plastics may have         different tendencies, and become taut and rubbery. It may be         necessary to open the oven door to poke a corner with a         dowel to determine how soft the plastic is. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When the magic moment arrives, turn         on the vacuum, open the oven door, and grab the frame (use         some sort of hand protection; gloves or potholder). Quickly         remove the frame and lay it over the mold, with the frame         centered over the mold and mask window. Once the frame         bottom seats flush with the mask window, the plastic will         immediately form over the mold. If it does not form well, it         is likely that either the plastic was not hot enough or the         vacuum cleaner is not powerful enough (shop vacuums are         best, but most regular vacuums should be able to do the         job). If the plastic was not hot enough and the plastic is         still intact, it may be possible to put the plastic back in         and reheat for another try. When the part has formed, turn         off the vacuum and let the plastic cool for about a minute         or so before trying to remove the mold.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is preferable to use an assembly         line approach so that the most parts can be formed in the         shortest period of time. Use a modeling knife to score the         plastic near the inner edges of the frame. Do this before         the plastic completely cools, as it will score more easily.         Once the plastic and frame are cool enough to take off of         the box, pop the mold out (if it will come out easily), and         with the aid of a modeling knife cut and rip the plastic         from the frame edges along the scored lines. Once done, put         the formed plastic portion aside and loosen the wingnuts of         the frame. It should be possible to remove the remaining         "crust" of plastic from the frame by pulling it from the         inside. Remove the removable bolts along one side of the         frame, slide in a new sheet of plastic, replace the bolts,         tighten the wingnuts, and you're ready to start forming         another part. Certain long parts with near-parallel sides         will not easily pop out, so this quick method will be slowed         down by the effort needed to remove the mold. Some parts may         turn out to be impossible to remove, so cut them carefully         off of the mold and try again.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A special note about using metal         molds. They should be preheated in the oven , then carefully         taken out (use gloves or mitts!) and placed on the vacuum         box before heating up the plastic in the oven (I must admit         I do not know just how hot it must be, but it does not have         to be close to the oven temperature. It may not need to be         any warmer than 150 degrees, which may be enough to prevent         forming problems while also not being too dangerous, no use         heating the mold beyond what is needed). The reason is that         if a metal mold is used cold, the hot plastic tends to cause         air bubbles to expand and create blisters on the surface of         the plastic. This tends to happen with metal molds due to         their acting like heat sinks, while other types of mold,         especially wooden ones, do not tend to have this problem.         The metal mold does not have to be reheated in the oven         every time you form a part, as it will remain warm or hot         for a period of time before cooling too much, and will         absorb an extra blast of heat every time a hot sheet of         plastic is vac-formed over it. Another reason for warming         the mold, a cold metal mold tends to cool and shrink the         plastic so quickly it can be very difficult to remove the         mold from the vac-formed part. By contrast, heated molds are         among the easiest to remove formed parts from, as long as         the part is not removed too early for it to be         distorted.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">More often than not some nose mold         shapes do not tend to be removed easily form the vac-formed         parts. This is especially true of nose shapes or other parts         which have some parallel or near-parallel sides (by contrast         conical shapes are the easiest to remove). The best         technique developed for removing reluctant nose molds is to         not try to pull straight back out, but to twist and pull. To         be able to grasp the mold to remove it, most of my molds         have holes drilled into the base of the molds so that 1/8"         rods can be inserted into them after forming, the rods used         as handles for twisting and pulling the mold out of the         vac-forming. However, the locations of the holes for the         rods must be carefully located so as not to cause wooden         molds to split, especially fragile balsa molds)</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Once a part has been formed over a         mold, it is possible to "clone" the mold by casting one         using the vac-forming as a female mold. Simply mount the         whole vac-formed sheet (before removing the part from the         scrap portion of the plastic sheet) upside down and pour in         the casting liquid (polyester resin is preferable) which         when hardened will create a duplicate of the original mold.         Due to shrinkage, the resulting new mold will be slightly         smaller, however, which may or may not be a problem         depending on its use (not of much concern for egg capsules,         very important for precise-fitting with the outside diameter         of a body tube).</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Trimming - For nose cones which         were formed on a mold turned on a drill or lathe face plate,         mount the mold again on the drill or lathe and put the part         on the mold, with some of the excess plastic taped to the         mold to hold the part in place. Carefully touch a modeling         knife to the nose cone as it spins on the mold to score the         plastic nose where it should be trimmed. This ensures the         nose shoulder will be straight when completely trimmed.         </FONT></P>                  <CENTER>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="GENERAL/vac/Vacuform3.GIF" WIDTH=392 HEIGHT=191 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Final Notes: Vacuum forming can do         some parts well, and others poorly or not at all. It's great         for some Sport Scale models but difficult for precision         scale parts due to the problems of controlling the final         thickness of the finished part, thus the external dimensions         of parts made with male molds in this way (and with this         crude type of vacuum forming). It takes some time to learn         how to do small noses such as BT-20 or smaller. Wayne         Hendricks has leanred how ot do thme fairly well, and have         made an art of forming ultralight 30mm noses for FAI models,         to the extent that all US Team members use "Wayne's cones"         for their 30mm Parachute and Streamer models.</FONT></P>                  <P><A HREF="SCALE/otherscale/Delta_1984.JPG"><IMG SRC="SCALE/otherscale/Delta_1984_s.JPG" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=100 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=left></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">Here         are some examples of what sort of parts have been made for         certain models: A Sport Scale Delta main core nose cone,         with 9 nose cones and 9 nozzles formed for the Castor         strap-ons (models with multiple parts like this are very         good vac-form candidates). It has been used to make dozens         of custom shaped egg capsules for Eggloft altitude and         Eggloft duration models. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It has also been used to make         special parts for models of the Space Shuttle. Originally         the parts were orbiter main engines and OMS pods (weighing         about 5 grams total at 1/72 scale and formed from .015-.02         plastic). With the all-up shuttle model the parts list         expanded to SRB noses and aft skirts, ET nose and aft dome,         and the orbiter nose section. The orbiter nose was formed by         using half shell molds from a plastic model kit. The orbiter         nose will not form in one piece, so it was formed in two         halves the same as the plastic kit and glued together with a         reinforcement strip inside of the seam. The most significant         forming was the ET nose, which is 4.6" diameter and about 7"         tall, weighing 30 grams. Originally it was formed in two         half-shells. More recently it was successfully formed in one         piece but one side had to be carefully split to allow         removing it from the mold. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">More recently our team has used         vac-forming to fabricate parts on the 1/39.5 scale Little         Joe II's we have been flying. Some parts are obvious         choices, such as the large BPC cone (or Capsule on earlier         Little Joe II's without BPC's), Escape rocket skirt, and         Escape rocket nose. All of the nozzles were also vac-formed,         the 4 escape rocket nozzles, 16 RCS thruster nozzles, and         the 4 Algol &amp; 2 Recruit motor nozzles. Non-round shapes         were also formed, the fin root fairings as well as the         elevon actuator fairings on the fins.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Other potential uses for special         models would be to create shells for unusual fuselage shapes         such as the shuttle orbiter, ME-163, Natter, and lifting         body models. It should even be possible to duplicate the old         Centuri Saturn model wrap-arounds by pouring polyester resin         in an unused wrap-around to create a male mold, then form         over the new resin mold with thin plastic. For that matter,         you can make up your own corrugation molds for vehicles such         as the Ariane and Shuttle ET intertank. Imagination may be         the only real limitation. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I hope this has taken some of the         mystery out of vacuum forming. It really isn't all that         difficult, and the results are usually well worth the         effort. Be careful, and have fun making your own custom         parts.</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A> <FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#99CCFF" WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom><A NAME=top></A></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="gcghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>George's         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../NARshuttle/shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         Shuttle Model AOL Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../RBGliders/rbghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>RBGliders         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
