Try other                  links there as well, such as the <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/competition/NARevents.html">Competition                  Events</A> page and the <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/competition/plans/competitionPlans.html">Plans</A>                  page.</P>                                    <P>The NAR's competition rule book is officially                  called the "U.S. Model Rocket Sporting Code". But                  since it has usually had a pink cover, it's more                  commonly referred to as the <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/pinkbook/index.html">Pink                  Book</A>.</P>                                    <P>The Pink Book has a lot of rules in it, and some                  people feel overwhelmed by them. A lot of the rules                  cover things as to how to run contests, or                  calculating contest points, which you realyl do not                  need to wade through in order to compete. So, each                  of the individual event tips pages posted here have                  their own short description and the basics for each                  event. However, if you want to really understand                  the finer points of the rules or are considering a                  design that may skirt the boundaries of the rules,                  by all means you should consult the <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/pinkbook/index.html">Pink                  Book</A>. For off-line access, a <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/cabinet/pinkbook.pdf">PDF                  version of the Pink Book</A> is available.</P>                                    <P><B>Getting Started</B> - Everyone has to start                  somewhere. It may be useful to identify a few                  events that you yourself find interesting to you,                  and concentrate more effort into preparing for                  those events over the other events.</P>                                    <P><B>Just Fly it</B> - Try some of the other                  events too, devoting less effort than some other                  ones you are keying on, but try none the less, and                  fly them. A lot is learned by just trying, and a                  lot is learned by competing for real, so the more                  experience you get now can pay off later.</P>                                    <P><B>Adaptability 101</B> - If you just can't make                  up contest models for many of the events, you can                  draft some of your sport models that can be adapted                  or pressed into use. A lot of 18mm models can be                  flown in B Streamer Duration. Others can be pressed                  into use for eggloft with the addition of an egg                  capsule. Of course, performance potential may be                  compromised. In some duration events, reduced                  performance potential could be considered a "good                  thing" - if a contestant loses their first model                  and needs to make sure they get their second model                  back. Although with this year's NARAM event                  selection, having specific "return flight" models                  is not as critical. At least not involving adapting                  sport models, since only the glider events and                  possibly helicopter event might make use of some                  low-performing "return" models.</P>                                    <P><B>Reliability 101</B> - In the long run,                  reliable models of lesser performance usually beat                  unreliable high performance ones. The fanciest                  high-concept model that is theoretically capable of                  outperforming everyone else's models means little                  if it can not perform reliably. For the new flier,                  it is better to go with something of a proven                  reliable design or competitive kit than try                  something more advanced or complex. Even advanced                  competitors fall victim to trying to squeeze                  performance too far, but when/if such models do                  fail, they understand that it is a gamble they                  chose to take.</P>                                    <P><B>Reliability 102</B> - Recovery Systems often                  fail. Kit type shock cords in general do not work                  well for most parachute/streamer recovery contest                  models. Do not glue shock cord anchors inside of                  body tubes (at least not the common kit types that                  are attached inside of the tube wall). These                  anchors are likely to make the recovery system jam                  inside the body tube and after a few flights the                  shock cords tend to break at the anchor and are                  impractical to fix. The most useful                  parachute/streamer shock cord system for most                  lightweight contest rockets is to use 100 pound                  Kevlar cord. For models with any significant                  weight, elastic shock cords are useful to absorb                  shock. Single egglofter type models can use 1/8"                  elastic, as can some not-too-heavy plastic models.                  Beyond that, 3/16" to 1/4" elastic can be employed                  to absorb shock in larger/heavier models such as                  plastic and scale models. For heavier rockets the                  parachutes should be strong enough. Over-the-top                  shroud line reinforcement is one method to                  strengthen a plastic parachute (See the Eggloft,                  Scale, or Plastic model articles on how to do                  this). In Scale, some modelers use fabric type                  chutes, but only if they have adequate room to                  store and safely eject the chute, since they take                  up more room for any given body tube storage space                  when compared to plastic chutes.</P>                                    <P><B>Reliability 103</B> - Wherever possible,                  test/practice fly your models. This might not be a                  solid requirement for kits or some designs built                  from a plan. However the more out of the ordinary                  something is to you, the more you should consider                  flying it at your home field to see how it                  performs. If you have designed your model yourself,                  absolutely test fly it. This can be a double edged                  sword, you want to fly it to see how it performs,                  but you do not want to lose your rocket if it                  performs well. You might want scale back on the                  engine power, but don't under power it to the point                  of crashing before ejection. Some full power                  testing might be needed though. A B Rocket Glider                  flown on an A does not prove the wing is strong                  enough for a B. However, if you have confidence the                  model (wing in that case) is built strong enough,                  then that might do. A really nice way to test,                  where possible, is to fly shortly after dawn, when                  the winds tend to be light. That only does you any                  good if you can fly at a site on short notice                  though.</P>                                    <P>Other testing doesn't necessarily risk losing                  the model, but shows that you have learned how to                  prep the model and fly well. Packing a chute for                  Egg Duration or Parachute Duration is an important                  thing to learn. The objective is to pack it in such                  a manner that you go with a big chute that deploys                  quickly after ejection. Or to test by prepping and                  flying models that use a unique method of recovery,                  such helicopter and rocket glider models, and the                  burn-thread/rubber band activation systems which                  many of those designs use.</P>                                    <P>Testing for events like Sport Scale and Plastic                  Model Conversion can be important as well. If you                  are making your own scale model, rather than                  building from a kit, a boilerplate model can be                  very useful. Same for Plastic Model. If you achieve                  first place after static judging, but the flight is                  disqualified, the static score doesn't count for                  anything. Boilerplate testing should include using                  the same shock cord and parachute system as you                  intend for the real model to use. If you test using                  one kind of chute and then use a different chute                  type for the actual contest model, then your                  testing did not prove out the recovery system. If                  there is any doubt as to stability, be sure that if                  your boilerplate flew successfully, that the "real"                  model has it's CG no further rearward than the                  boilerplate's CG location.</P>                                    <P><B>Why are some plans so old, or so few?</B> -                  Various reasons. Some plans are fairly well proven.                  The Rotaroc design for helicopter has not changed                  much since 1978. Same for Streamer models and some                  Gliders. Some events are not flown very often,                  while for other events the rules have changed                  significantly over time (B Payload, such as Jim                  Cook's 1980 plan for the old 1/2" long lead                  payload). Many of the higher performance engines                  that used to be available in the past are no longer                  produced or contest certified (like Apogee 10.5mm                  micro motors and 13mm B7's). Plans for those models                  are now moot.

There is a <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/pdf/magindex.pdf">magazine                  index</A>, compiled by Lila Schmaker, you can use                  to see what contest articles, plans, and scale data                  have been published in the magazine through                  1999.</P>                                    <P><B>It's not a beauty contest</B> (except for the                  craftsmanship events) - For Duration and Altitude                  events, great finishing and painting can make for                  great looking models, but the model's appearance                  won't get you any bonus seconds or bonus meters. A                  lot of finishing and paint can be detrimental to                  many duration type models, because of the extra                  weight making the models descend faster than if                  they were lighter. A lot of people fly duration                  models that are unpainted, or use some magic marker                  for coloring. For Altitude models it is a closer                  call, since low drag means smooth surfaces. So some                  try to hit a balance between a really good smooth                  finish without really weighing down the model too                  much.</P>                                    <P><B>But build them well</B> - Build the models to                  fly straight and true. Work towards attaching all                  of the fins so they are straight and parallel to                  the body. This should translate to a straight                  boost, with minimal wobbling that would hurt the                  altitude. Even Duration models get better times                  when they fly higher than they would if they                  wobbled.</P>                                    <P><B>To eject, or not to eject? </B>- That is the                  question. Very few contest rockets use engine                  hooks. So the engines are often friction fitted in,                  using tape on the engine to build up the diameter.                  Sometimes the friction fit is not enough though,                  and the combination of the recovery system,                  wadding, and in some events tracking powder, is too                  much for the ejection charge to push out forward,                  so the engine ejects out the back instead. So, at                  the least, be sure to get a good friction fit of                  the engine in the tube.</P>                                    <P>Some designs move the fins up a bit on the body                  tube, so the body tube sticks down about 1/4-1/2"                  or so below the trailing edges of the fins. This                  allows for a second line of defense to be used to                  try to keep the engine from ejecting out. A collar                  wrap of tape is applied so that half the tape width                  is around the end of the body tube, and the other                  half is around the engine. You will see several                  plans that have this design feature. If you are                  using a plan or kit that does not have this                  feature, and want to move the fins up, make sure it                  is a very stable design or you may need to make the                  fins a little bit bigger.</P>                                    <P>Also, try to not cram things tightly inside the                  body to begin with. Test-prep the model without                  engine, and using lung power, blow into the engine                  mount simulate and ejection charge (of course, do                  not do this with tracking powder or you will have a                  mess everywhere, including on yourself!). If you                  can't get the nose and recovery system to eject                  out, or if it was very hard to do so, that will                  increase the chances that the engine will eject.                  So, refine the prepping methods and keep testing                  till you find a method that ejects easily enough.                  And remember to prep that same way when you fly for                  real.</P>                                    <P><B>Lariat Loop Shock Cord attachment</B> - Ed                  LaCroix (creator and former owner of Apogee                  Components) has popularized a method that allows a                  Kevlar shock cord to be directly attached to the                  engine. Tie a slip knot in the end of the Kevlar                  shock cord and tighten it around the nozzle end of                  the engine. Wrap one layer of 1/2" mylar tape                  (available from ASP) around the Kevlar. This keeps                  the kevlar in place and also acts as a thrust ring.                  The tape in front of the engine will go INSIDE the                  body tube so that the bulge in the tape from the                  Kevlar becomes the thrust ring. Insert the Kevlar                  and engine into the body tube until about 1/4" of                  the engine still sticks out. Then wrap the body                  tube and engine with another layer of mylar tape.                  If the engine should manage to eject, it remains                  with the model so a DQ is avoided (as long as some                  means of safe recovery deploys).</P>                                    <P>The above method has some extra benefits. Since                  the Kevlar is not attached to the body tube, it can                  be easily replaced. It also does not block the                  inside of the tube, as some other internal shock                  cord mounts used. It has a couple of drawbacks,                  though. The Kevlar cord is not easily burned, bit                  it CAN be burned apart if exposed to too much of an                  ejection charge. 100 pound Kevlar holds up well to                  18mm Ejection charges and smaller. But a D12 or E9                  ejection charge will definitely burn 100 pound                  Kevlar. So for larger engines, use stronger Kevlar,                  at least for the first few inches in front of the                  ejection charge. Or add some form of protection                  such as heat-shrink tubing in the portion of the                  Kevlar that is exposed to the ejection charge                  heat.</P>                                    <P>Another drawback is that Kevlar cord does not                  absorb shock. For some events this is not too much                  of an issue, such as Parachute &amp; Streamer                  Duration, as the models are fairly light. But for                  others such as Egglofters, Plastic Models, and                  Scale Models, it is an issue. Those models usually                  need to have their shock cords stretch to absorb                  shock at chute deployment. So, the appropriate size                  and length of elastic is suggested for most of the                  shock cord (Kevlar and elastic can be used together                  such as Lariat Loop to run the cord inside the body                  then transitioning to elastic outside of the top of                  the tube).</P>                                    <P><B>Flights per event &amp; scoring</B> - In most                  events, you are allowed two flights, weather                  permitting.</P>                                    <P>In Altitude events, your score is based on the                  best single flight. If a qualified flight is not                  tracked (or the tracking data does not close), you                  can get a re-flight.</P>                                    <P>In Duration events, usually, your score is a                  TOTAL of the flights made (the exception being                  Eggloft Duration, where the best single flight with                  the egg returned intact is your score).</P>                                    <P>In Multi-Round Duration events, three flights                  are allowed, each with a maximum time cap. If there                  is a tie for first at the end of three rounds of                  flying, then those who are tied enter an additional                  flyoff round.</P>                                    <P>In Craftsmanship events (like Scale &amp;                  Plastic Model Conversion), two flights are allowed.
