Nothing can come off - no pop-pods, no         parasites, no ejected engine. It cannot be staged. The         glider must be <B>returned</B> for one of the two flights         allowed.</P>                  <P>Flex-wing (Rogallo/hang glider) type gliders are not         allowed.</P>                  <P>For the <B>full rules</B> for this event, please see the         <A HREF="http://www.nar.org/pinkbook/37_RG.html">Rocket         Glide Rules</A> on the NAR web page.</P>                  <P><B>Scoring </B>- For Rocket Glide, the scoring is the         total of two flights allowed, but at least one of those         flights must have the glider returned.</P>                  <P><B>Design considerations</B> - Difficulty of making and         flying a glider that does not have any parts come off in         flight (Often with a design that uses some sort of moving         parts like a sliding wing or sliding pod). Trade-offs of         high glider performance and visibility with surviving rocket         boost, and trying to get at least a reasonable boost         altitude.</P>                  <P>Rocket Glider designs are more specialized than Boost         Gliders, so it is not recommended for newer fliers to try to         design their own. Best to go with a kit such as those below,         or a plan. With experience, you might later develop a knack         for designing your own gliders, but it's best to learn from         something proven first.</P>                  <P>A <A HREF="#plans">list of plans and kits</A> is included         further down on this page.<BR>         </P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Designs</B></FONT> - Many basic design         approaches have been used for Rocket Glide.

They tend to boost very         straight. The wing slide mechanics are somewhat more         difficult to build than others, but it is usually worth         it.</P>                  <P><B>Slide-pod</B> - A long engine pod about the length of         a normal pop-pop is used. The pod is forward on boost         (making the CG forward like a normal pop-pod B/G) then at         ejection slides back so that the CG is where it needs to be         for glide. It is a reasonable approach which usually boosts         OK, and is easier to build than a slide-wing. Well-made         slide wings tend to perform better than well-made         slide-pods. Slide-pod models use a telescoping external tube         glued to the pylon, such as 20mm telescoping tubing, for a         BT-20 sliding pod tube to freely slide inside of.</P>                  <P><B>Auto-Elevator</B> - A design which does not move the         wing, or move the CG, but changes the angle of the elevator         (or canard). The elevator has to be flat (straight) for         boost so there is no incidence angle between the wing and         tail, so the model will boost straight. For glide, the         elevator moves up (or canard trailing edge moves down). This         is often one of the simplest and easiest rocket glider         designs to use. Although depending on the particular model         design, the performance potential might be compromised.</P>                  <P>The Xebec-B is an auto-elevator design, which is easy to         build as R/G's go. But it is somewhat finicky as to how         straight it boosts, varying from model to model (and         sometimes modeler to modeler). Usually it if does not boost         straight, it pitches up a bit onto its back, due to         unintended slight up elevator angle.</P>                  <P><B>Swing-Wing</B> - Originally a definitive early design         for Rocket Gliders, the wings pivot from rearward for boost         to forward for glide. They are neat to see fly and deploy,         but tend to be too heavy and complex to be competitive other         than in the higher engine classes. For B engine class, it's         not very competitive.</P>                  <P><B>No Moving Part</B>s - A special design that, as it's         name says, has no moving parts. So, it is about the simplest         Rocket Glider to build (That has wings, anyway). This         approach was tried when the event was first created, but         only experts had any decent success trimming their models to         boost straight and transition to a glide. More recently,         Kevin Wickart has come up with a design called the         "<A HREF="http://www.wooshrocketry.org/Designs/Kevin%20Wickart/Mediocre_Fred/Mediocre%20Fred.htm">Mediocre         Fred</A>", which is not as finicky as the early designs, but         must be built exactly as described. It was a plan in Sport         Rocketry magazine, and also is available online on the WOOSH         website. It is designed for D power, but can be flown on a         B6-2. Ideally, for B class it should be scaled down.</P>                  <P><B>"Backslider" Superroc Rocket Glider</B> - Bob and         Peter Alway wrote a <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/petealway/srrg.htm">winning         R&amp;D report</A> resulting in the "Backslider" plan. It is         a type of super roc rocket glider, which is basically a long         skinny "normal" rocket going up, that glides down backwards         using lift from the long body tube and fins (read the report         to understand how). It does not glide very well compared to         normal R/G's, but has been used by some for qualified         flights and "return" flights. And in some smaller contests         has taken places when used as the primary (or only) model a         competitor flew. Depending on the resulting CG due to the         parts used and assembly, a given Backslider model might         require a little bit of clay (not too much) to be added to         the root of one fin to make sure it glides backwards, rather         than falling horizontally (which is not a glide).                  <HR>                  </P>                  <P><B>Deployment magic</B> - The above R/G designs         (excluding the Backslider and No Moving Parts designs) use         the ejection charge only as a starting point to cause the         design to go from rocket boost mode to glide mode. Usually         rubber bands are used to make the wings slide, pods slide,         wings swing, or elevator to move. What keeps them from         moving until ejection? Usually a burn-thread which is rigged         to hold the model in boost mode. At ejection, the thread         burns, allowing the rubber bands to do their thing.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD ALIGN=center VALIGN=bottom>                  <P><A HREF="Pics2/NoseThread.gif"><IMG SRC="Pics2/NoseThread-tb.gif" WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=140 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <A HREF="Pics2/NoseThread.gif">Burn Thread Prep at                  Nose</A></P>               </TD>               <TD ALIGN=center VALIGN=bottom>                  <P><A HREF="Pics2/SlideWingBurnThread.gif"><IMG SRC="Pics2/SlideWingBurnThread-tb.gif" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=140 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <A HREF="Pics2/SlideWingBurnThread.gif">Slide-Wing                  Prep</A></P>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=bottom>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Pics2/SlidePodprep.gif"><IMG SRC="Pics2/SlidePodprep-tb.gif" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=140 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  Slide-Pod Prep</A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=bottom>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Pics2/SwingWingPrep.gif"><IMG SRC="Pics2/SwingWingPrep-tb.gif" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=140 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <A HREF="Pics2/SwingWingPrep.gif">Swing-Wing                  Prep</A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <P>For Auto-Elevator prep, see the <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/GCGassaway/contest/Xebec_B.pdf">Xebec-B         plan</A>. Only a light pull is needed to make the elevator         pop up: instead of a rubber band, elastic thread tied into a         loop of the proper length should be used. A too-strong pull         might make it difficult to force the elevator flat for         boost.</P>                  <P>The burn thread needs to be thin so it will burn easily.         The button and carpet type of thread that Estes uses for         shroud lines is too thick for anything short of a D12         ejection charge to burn. So use a finer thread. I prefer to         use white elastic thread, which will snap free when it         burns.</P>                  <P>The rubber bands need to be selected carefully. Do not         grab just any rubber band and try to force it to stretch         really far, as it might cause the model to actually break         itself when the band force causes the model's parts to slam         into each other too hard at ejection. Look for rubber bands         with 1/16" cross sections, in various lengths, at Office         Supply type stores. Look for the classic pale brown latex         bands, colored bands tend to not stretch as much. While the         band should not be stretched so much that it causes         excessive force, it should not be relaxed at the end of         travel so that there is slack, as it might not deploy the         wings, pod, etc, 100% as it needs to. This is not hard to         get right, just it can cause trouble if it's overlooked.                  <HR>                  </P>                  <P><B>Building Gliders</B> - Jeff Vincent's Nocturne         Slide-Wing Rocket Glider plan includes a lot of useful         instructions on how to build, trim, and fly a Rocket Glider.

But the general "how to build and fly glider" information in         those instructions is very useful.</P>                  <P>Kevin Wickart wrote a nice short article on how to do         quick and easy airfoils, on the WOOSH section's website.         <A HREF="http://www.wooshrocketry.org/Tips/Kevin%20Wickart/tips2.htm">Click         here</A> to read it.</P>                  <P>A VERY nice sanding block, useful for gliders,         helicopter, and any rocket really, is an all-metal 2-piece         clamp-type sanding block made by Red Devil, carried by most         Ace Hardware stores (look near where they stock sandpaper).         It has a 1/8" foam rubber backing sheet, which ought to be         removed since it allows rounding things too easily in 3-D         when you usually want to shape in 2-D at a given time (as         with a wing). So, remove the rubberized portion. That         sanding block holds a 4.5 x 5.5" sheet of sandpaper (quarter         of a 9 x 11" sheet), with a 3.5 x 4.5" sanding surface area         on the block. This works far better in most cases than a         narrow sanding block. Of course, the wings (or fins) should         be shaped and finished before they are glued to the fuselage         or model.</P>                  <P>When doing very rough shaping for wings, 80 to 120 grit         sandpaper is good to grind off a lot of wood in a short         time. Don't over-do it though by sanding off too much. Then         go to finer grit like 180 to 220 for finer shaping. Beyond         that, 280/320 paper, is sort of a cross between final         shaping and setting up for a final finish. A final finish         for bare balsa is to use 400 grit paper. Get the "black"         type wet or dry sandpaper, it sands better and lasts longer         than the reddish types. If you use any clear dope, use 320         to 400 grit paper before and after.</P>                  <P><B>Glider Finish</B> - Never use paint on a contest type         glider. For newer fliers, no finish is usually fine. You don         't want to weigh the model down too much and maybe having         warpage problems. If you want to improve the finish, use         some thinned clear dope in one or two light coats, sanding         before and after with 240 and 400 grit sandpaper. The idea         it not to add weight or cause the wood parts to warp. Some         fliers like to use a Japanese tissue finish, but that is         more for experts and to an extent is overkill for B         R/G's.</P>                  <P><B>Coloring</B> - OK, so bare balsa (even with clear         dope) is not easy to see in the air or on the ground. Use a         large black magic marker to color the bottom of the wing and         tail surfaces black, as that shows up against the sky pretty         well. Use a large red or orange magic marker to color the         top surfaces. If you can find true fluorescent markers (not         to be confused with wimpy fluorescent highlighters), an         orange or red/magenta fluorescent color is highly         recommended.</P>                  <P><B>Glide trimming</B> - It is an understatement to say         that it is very important to trim the glider to glide         properly. It's not easy to describe just how to do so.</P>                  <P>One mostly universal tip is to have the tail of the         glider and the wing to not be parallel to each other (zero         incidence). There ought to be a little bit of "up elevator"         angle in the tail, relative to the wing, to make the nose         pull up a bit. Some plans/kits may be quite specific, and in         those cases go with what they say (for example the Xebec-B         auto-elevator design requires absolute zero incidence for a         straight boost, then up elevator for glide). Note that free         flight model airplane experts sometimes prefer zero         incidence, but they are deeply experienced (usually) to have         just the right touch and experience to get away with it.</P>                  <P>The above being said, one of the simple ways to achieve         slight up elevator effect (without adding too much) is to         build the model zero-zero (wing and stabilizer parallel to         each other), then warp the trailing edge of the stabilizer         up. Make sure that the fuselage itself is not warped "down"         - if it is warped at all, better to be warped "up" relative         to the wing and stabilizer.</P>                  <P><B>Special trimming notes for Rocket Gliders</B> -</P>                  <UL>            <LI>Always <B>trim with a burned-out engine casing</B> in            the model, using the same engine type you will fly it            with. If you trim with no engine, or an unfired engine,            the CG you try to trim for will not be where the real            flight's glide CG will be.</LI>                        <LI>For Slide-Wing models, do not glue the forward wing            stops on before going out to do some basic trimming. Use            tape to hold the wing from sliding along the fuselage,            and do a few trim throws to see if you have the wing in            the right ballpark location. If the model seems tail            heavy, move the wing back a bit, and re-tape. If it seems            nose heavy, move the wing forward a bit, and re-tape.            When it seems to be in the right spot, use a pencil or            pen to mark on the fuselage exactly where the wing should            stop, then later glue the stops on at that location.</LI>                        <LI>For Slide-Pod models, do not glue on the glide            position stop ring (near the front) to the slide pod            until you've done a similar series of rough glide trim            tosses as described above for slide-wings, in order to            determine where the slide pod should stop for glide.</LI>                        <LI>For Auto-Elevator models, the trimming is unique. The            elevator needs to be absolutely flat on boost, so the            model will boost straight. Auto-elevator models tend to            be designed a bit nose-heavy, so there should be no need            to add any noseweight. So the way to trim an            auto-elevator model (at least as far as pitch trim), is            to adjust the elevator angle until it glides properly. If            it stalls, adjust for less elevator. If it goes into a            shallow dive or just feels like it is gliding too fast,            adjust for more up elevator.</LI>         </UL>                  <P><B>General trimming tips from a number of different         sources:</B></P>                  <P><A HREF="http://www.esteseducator.com/Pdf_files/2266.pdf"><B>Estes         Boost Glider Technical Report</B></A>, written by Tom Beach         (pdf file from Estes Educator website).

Items 6 thru 9 are useful for trimming         gliders for optimum glide performance.</P>                  <P>Again, Ed LaCroix's <A HREF="http://plans.rocketshoppe.com/apogee/Maxima/apoMaxima.htm">instructions         for the Maxima A Boost Glider</A> has trimming tips.</P>                  <P><A HREF="http://f4bscale.worldonline.co.uk/launch.htm">Hand         Launch Glider trimming tips</A> for beginners, from a         British Free Flight model airplane site. The latter portions         about hard throws (necessary for contest HL gliders) is not         too relevant for rocket boosted gliders (since the F/F HL         glider fliers's hard upward throws are their equivalents to         our rocket "boosts"). Note the basic glide trim info and         illustrations at the top of the page.</P>                  <P><B>Launching</B> - Set up the glider on the pad so that         it faces into the wind. This means the wing bottom faces         upwind, and the wing top faces downwind. Actually the         dihedral effect will usually try to make the glider face         that way.</P>                  <P>Some people prefer to make their own glider launcher that         has the launch rod mounted onto a 3/8" or 1/2" dowel, so         that the whole rod can be used for guidance.</P>                  <P>A classic launch problem is for the micro-clips to fall         at ignition to grab onto the glider wing or tail, causing         damage or even disaster. Some prefer to tape the clips to         the rod so they can't fall, which is effective but a bit         messy. Others like to use an umbilical approach. They         arrange for a separate launch rod, dowel, or other structure         to hold the micro clip wires away from the glider, so when         the clips fall they will not fall straight down, but swing         away in an arc from the glider. A simple umbilical is to use         a piece of 1/4 x 1/4 spruce 18" long or so, and cut the         bottom at a very sharp angle that is about 30 degrees from         vertical. Then glue a launch lug to the angled part. That         way, the spruce umbilical can be slipped over the launch         rod, umbilical angled at 30 degrees from the rod, ready for         the micro-clips to be attached to it. Put your name on it,         since the next person to use that pad will probably want to         remove your umbilical.</P>                  <P><B>More Information</B>:</P>                  <UL>            <LI>See the <A HREF="http://www.ninfinger.org/%7Esven/rockets/rmrfaq.8.html">RMR            Rocket Boosted Glider FAQ</A> (Frequently Asked            Questions).
