This is quite a challenge to do                  well.</P>                                    <P>The Plastic Model must be of a rocket, space                  vehicle, or a jet whose engines are in or spaced                  apart to the rear of the fuselage. No cars, no fire                  engines, no ships, etc. The model has to                  essentially be based on one Plastic Model kit, not                  a conglomeration of kits (no Saturn-V with shuttle                  SRB's).</P>                                    <P>Plastic Model entries cannot exceed 1500 grams                  (approximately 3.3 pounds) mass at liftoff. In this                  event, it is rare that anyone has a model close to                  the mass limit.</P>                                    <P>The model must make at least one safe and stable                  flight (two flights are allowed), otherwise the                  model is disqualified and the static score is                  useless. The model can be clustered or staged                  (stages need to recover in a safe manner: a                  Saturn-V first stage tumbling to the ground "like                  the real thing" would be disqualifed). Clustering                  or staging is not recommended though for                  inexperienced fliers.</P>                                    <P><B>Entering for judging</B>: Turn-in for static                  judging will be Sunday night. The model needs to be                  entered in the same condition it will be for                  flight. No parts added or removed, other than                  internal parts such as the recovery system or                  engine(s). Your NAR number should be on the model,                  many people use decals or dry transfers. A display                  stand of some type is useful, but not required. The                  stand is not judged but is nice to keep the model                  from falling over, as well as holding certain model                  types at a desired viewing angle.</P>                                    <P><B>Scoring </B>- For Plastic Model Conversion,                  the model is judged in advance for a static score,                  based on Craftsmanship and Difficulty. When flown,                  it is also judged for General flight points                  (including lack of flight damage), and "Mission"                  points. The model is allowed to make two flights,                  the best single qualified flight score is used. The                  final score is a total of the static score plus                  best flight score.</P>                                    <P><B>Engines</B> - You can use any NAR <A HREF="contest_certified.htm"><B>Contest                  </B>Certified engine</A> that is suitable,                  considering the weight and drag of your model and                  the time delay to ejection. However, the maximum                  engine total impulse allowed is 160 Newton-Seconds                  (Full G power). The sum of the total impulses of                  the engines in clusters and multiple stages cannot                  exceed 160 N-sec.</P>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="+1">For the <B>full rules</B> for                  this event, please see the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.nar.org/pinkbook/55_PMC.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Plastic                  Model Conversion Rules</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">                  on the NAR web page.</FONT></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>                  <HR>                  In addition to the article below, check out the Plastic         Model Conversion article written by Jeff Vincent, in the         <A HREF="http://www.astre471.org/Newsletter/sd1999-0708.pdf">July/August         1999 issue</A> of ASTRE's "Stardust" newsletter         (downloadable PDF issue, 3.6 megs).<BR>         </P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD ALIGN=center VALIGN=top WIDTH=580 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=560 HEIGHT=10>                     <TR>                        <TD WIDTH=429 HEIGHT=100>                           <CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Converting                           Plastic Models for Rocket                           Flight</B></FONT></CENTER>                                                      <P>by George Gassaway (originally printed                           in Sport Rocketry Magazine. copyright                           1996, slight revision 2003)</P>                                                      <P>Ever since the early days of the hobby,                           rocketeers have tried to make plastic                           models fly as model rockets. Some models                           worked well, others "re-kitted" themselves                           shortly after launch. NAR members have an                           additional reasons for flight converting                           plastic models, because of the "Pink Book"                           Plastic Model competition event. This                           article is written mostly with competition                           in mind.</P>                                                      <P><B>Model choice is critical</B>. The                           more the plastic model is like a normal                           rocket (with good fin area, room for                           noseweight, and plenty of room for the                           recovery system) the better the chances of                           a reliable safe flight. The Glencoe Models                           1/48 Jupiter-C is ideal for conversion,                           and is highly recommended for a modeler's                           first conversion (this was one of the                           earliest conversions from the early 1960's                           when the model was made by Hawk).                           Unfortunately, almost all other rocket                           kits are not as easy. Jets are even                           harder, and some sci-fi space kits are                           almost impossible (Millennium Falcon                           anyone?). For competition, it is far                           better to choose something simple that is                           likely to work, and therefore qualify,                           than to try something harder that may have                           a better preflight score but crashes and                           is disqualified. Nobody wants to spend a                           lot of time and effort on a model that is                           likely to crash.</P>                                                      <CENTER><A HREF="pics/Juno_SaturnL.gif"><B><IMG SRC="pics/Juno_SaturnS.gif" WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=166 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></A><B><BR>                           </B><I>click drawing to see at twice                           size</I></CENTER>                                                      <P>When considering models to convert,                           don't wait until the last minute. Look                           around and find out what kits are                           available. Your local hobby shop may not                           have a kit you have in mind but might be                           able to order it &emdash; ask them. Check                           out mail order suppliers in plastic model                           magazines, Squadron mail order is a good                           source. Countdown Hobbies also has a good                           selection of rocket/space plastic                           kits.</P>                                                      <P>In Plastic Model competition, only                           models of space and sci-fi vehicles, and                           jets with engines near the rear of the                           fuselage, are legal (if in doubt, ask).

Plastic models are                           generally heavy, and most require the                           addition of extra noseweight. Estimate the                           completed model weight, ready to fly, and                           determine what kind of engine power is                           necessary for the job based on other                           models of similar weight (and drag).</P>                                                      <P>The thrustline should be through the                           center of gravity of the model, or very                           close to it. If not, the model will pitch                           over under thrust. Fortunately for                           "normal" rockets this is simple, the                           cylindrical body of a Saturn-V-type model                           means the center of gravity will be in the                           center of the body. The shuttle orbiter                           conversion shown in this article has a                           tendency to pitch nose-down at liftoff                           because the engine mount centering rings                           place the thrustline above the CG, not                           through it. It will launch OK if angled 10                           degrees from vertical, on its back, so                           that it pitches toward vertical. However,                           it is best to make the thrustline go                           through the CG to begin with by cutting                           custom centering rings with the engine                           tube hole offset toward the CG location                           (in which case the orbiter could be                           launched vertically).</P>                                                      <CENTER><A HREF="pics/Orbiter.gif"><IMG SRC="pics/OrbiterS.gif" WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=130 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                           <I>click drawing to see at twice                           size</I></CENTER>                                                      <P>Jet models have this kind of problem                           more than rocket models. The likely center                           of gravity of the completed model needs to                           be determined, then the engine mount must                           be glued in at the proper angle for the                           thrustline to go through the CG. One way                           to do this is to tape the model parts                           together, including any noseweight you                           plan to add. Insert a disk or bulkhead in                           the engine mount area with a string                           attached where the nozzle throat would be,                           then suspend the model nose-down. Sight                           down the string to see if the nose of the                           model points away from vertical, if so,                           note the angle. The thrustline needs to                           match this angle when the engine mount is                           glued in place.</P>                                                      <P>Twin-engine jets have an even greater                           problem: Both motors must ignite at the                           same time or the jet may yaw at liftoff.                           If one motor fails to ignite at all, the                           model will certainly crash. Even the                           experts crash these models, so they are                           not recommended at all for early                           conversions. Some models, like the F-15,                           are well suited to run the engine tubes                           from the tailcones to the air intakes.                           However, jets like the F-14 and Mig-29                           have CG/thrust mismatch problems &emdash;                           with those models the engine mounts must                           be aimed through the CG, then the internal                           tubing is "bent" with a coupler to angle                           down, allowing ejection out through the                           air intakes (similar to F-16 conversion).                           If you really want to convert a                           twin-engine jet, but want to greatly                           improve the chances of success, consider                           adapting the model to use a single engine                           in the center. An example of this would be                           converting the SR-71 by cutting off the                           fuselage rear tailcone and putting an                           engine mount there instead of placing                           engines at the "real" jet engine                           locations.</P>                                                      <CENTER><A HREF="pics/F16L.gif"><IMG SRC="pics/F16S.gif" WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=126 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                           <I>click drawing to see at twice                           size</I></CENTER>                                                      <P>A really nice tip from Kevin Kuczek is                           to use a small cheap keychain type laser                           pointer to help determine the alignment of                           thrustlines in difficult models such as                           jets. Mount the keychain laser centered in                           a manner that keeps it aligned inside the                           motor tube, then you can adjust the motor                           tube till the laser beam shines on the                           place near the nose that you want it to.                           It can take some creativity to be able to                           see where the laser light is shining                           inside. If there is a nose tip or anything                           up front that can be removed, temporarily                           remove it then place something translucent                           like paper across the opening, you will be                           able to see the light coming thru.</P>                                                      <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                  </TABLE>                  </P>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top>                  <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#E6E6DF" WIDTH=150>                     <TR>                        <TD VALIGN=top HEIGHT=36>                           <CENTER><B>NARAM-45 models</B>                                                      <P>(Click on thumbnails)</P></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=160>                           <CENTER><A HREF="pics/P8030024.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics/P8030024-tb.JPG" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=20>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=160>                           <CENTER><A HREF="pics/P8030029.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics/P8030029-tb.JPG" WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=20>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=160>                           <CENTER><A HREF="pics/P8070003.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics/P8070003-tb.JPG" WIDTH=89 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=20>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=160>                           <CENTER><A HREF="pics/P8070005.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics/P8070005-tb.JPG" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=20>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=160>                           <CENTER><A HREF="pics/P8070008.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics/P8070008-tb.JPG" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=20>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=150>                           <CENTER><A HREF="pics/P8070013.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics/P8070013-tb.jpg" WIDTH=71 HEIGHT=134 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=20>                           <P></P>                        </TD>                     </TR>                     <TR>                        <TD HEIGHT=160>                           <CENTER><A HREF="pics/P8070016.jpg"><IMG SRC="pics/P8070016-tb.JPG" WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                        </TD>                     </TR>                  </TABLE>                  </CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         <B>Stability: </B>Just about every plastic model needs some         help to be stable. The easy way is to add noseweight (such         as clay, or small lead fishing weights embedded in clay),         which is fine for some models. For other models, the engine         may not be able to lift any additional weight, or there may         not be room to add noseweight, or the fins may be too small,         or non-existent, so the fin area must be increased. You can         get sheet plastic at most hobby shops, 0.04" styrene is a         typical thickness to use. Models such as the Saturn-V can         benefit from having the fins made somewhat larger, the old         Estes kit used fins that were larger than scale. Since the         contest event is "plastic conversion", and not "plastic         scale conversion," you do have the leeway to make fins         oversized even if it's out of scale. The "cardboard cutout"         method can be useful in determining the Center of Pressure         (CP), indicating whether the fins are large enough or if         noseweight may be needed after all.</P>                  <P>Some models that have no fins can use clear plastic fins,         or you could choose to use normal opaque painted plastic.         Clear fins are notoriously difficult to glue on neatly and         mask off for painting. But if you choose to use clear fins,         you can get the 0.04" clear plastic made by Plastruct. That         clear plastic is a bit flexible, this is not a problem for         small fins but can be for large fins. If flexing is a         problem, try to find cheap clear plastic boxes to         cannibalize for stiff clear fin material. However, one of         the most ideal clear fin materials is Lexan (aka         Polycarbonate). You can find 1/32" and 1/16" thicknesses of         it sold by Micro-Mark. Do not use Cyanoacrylate to attach         clear fins, not only does it not work well, but it often         frosts up the plastic. Use a liquid plastic cement for         bonding clear fins to the plastic kit.</P>                  <P>If you have the skill to do it neatly, and if the model         is suitable, you can use the slot and tab method with the         clear fins. Cut the fins with a tab in the root meant to fit         into a slot in he plastic model. And use great care in         cutting out slots that are just exactly the width of the fin         thickness, or maybe a hair undersize then file slightly         wider as needed. Be careful about the use of liquid cement         to glue the fin in place. Mask off the fins very carefully         so that paint won't creep onto the clear fin.</P>                  <P>Also keep in mind that a model has to be stable in both         pitch and yaw. If one were to convert a Klingon Battle         Cruiser (something best left to experts) it might be stable         in pitch but not in yaw, so rudder-like fins may be         needed.</P>                  <P>Some models with wings can be technically "stable" but         pitch up (or down) due to a different incidence angle         between the wings and tail surfaces. Check that the angle of         attack of the wing and the horizontal tail surface         (stabilizer) are the same. If the tail is at a different         angle, the model is likely to loop into the ground due to         the aerodynamic lift generated (the 1/32 Revell X-1 has this         problem). It will be necessary to attach the tail surfaces         at a different angle of attack so that they are parallel         with the wing angle of attack.</P>                  <P>If you still have doubts about whether the model may         pitch due to thrust or aerodynamics, you can make the model         roll to help even out the pitch, in a "barrel roll" boost.         This can be done by adding spin tabs to fins, or cutting         &amp; gluing ailerons to make the model roll.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="pics/F104L.gif"><IMG SRC="pics/F104S.gif" WIDTH=312 HEIGHT=100 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <I>click drawing to see at twice size</I>                  <P>&#91; <B>&nbsp;QCR </B>has special <A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/model.html">kits         for the F-104 and F-100</A> jets, which come with everything         needed for conversion (parts) as well as instructions.         &#93;</P></CENTER>                  <P><B>Ejection:</B> When the ejection charge fires, where it         is going and where will the chutes be pushed out? In a         simple conversion this is no problem, the engine mount tube         can run all the way through the model, or it can be glued         with centering rings into a larger tube for the parachute         compartment. But, if the recovery system is going to come         out at a different angle than the engine thrustline, the         ejection charge needs to be ducted in some way. For a model         like the F-16, it is possible to do a "bent tube" ejection         by having the front of the engine mount tube join the rear         of the recovery system's tube with one centering ring, glued         at an angle instead of straight. For others, it could be         more complex, using a tube that is ducted or even a series         of tubes that do a zig-zag or a 180 degree turnaround to         eject out of the rear.</P>                  <P>No matter where the ejection charge is routed, the         ejection heat does tend to damage the first 2-3 inches of         tube ahead of the engine (with composite motors there is         some significant smoldering flame after ejection). The         exposed areas can be protected by adding in a tube coupler         or a layer of epoxy, or using thin CA soaked into the         paper.</P>                  <P>Some models may be suited for rear-ejection. An ejecting         engine mount tube with centering rings glued to it, freely         slides out of a larger tube plugged at the forward end. The         recovery system is stored in the space between the outside         of the engine tube and the inside of the larger tube. The         ejection speed is high, sometimes shock cords snap trying to         stop the ejecting mount tube. It is recommended to use         separate chutes and shock cords, so that problem can be         avoided (see the shuttle orbiter conversion).</P>                  <P>Some models have no obvious or easy location for the         separation joint which allows the parachute to eject, you         may need to make your own nose section separation point.         Wrap masking tape around the body as a guide and use a razor         saw to carefully cut the body apart. This can be         particularly useful for some jets (see the F-105), allowing         complete cockpit detail to be used.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="pics/F105L.gif"><IMG SRC="pics/F105S.gif" WIDTH=312 HEIGHT=154 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <I>click drawing to see at twice size</I></CENTER>                  <P><B>Recovery system: </B>It is important to have a good         strong reliable shock cord and parachute system for the         model. Plastic models are heavy and tend to stress the         recovery system a lot at deployment. To keep the parachute         compartment tube clear, try to mount the shock cord to the         outside of the tube, but still inside the plastic model. One         approach is to use flexible wire cable, secured deep in the         model, with a looped end coming out at the front to tie the         real shock cord to (see the F-105). Or, secure 50-100 pound         test Kevlar line inside the tube, extending it out a few         inches to allow shock cord attachment (Kevlar line is         heat-resistant, but beware that for example D12 type         ejection charges will burn thru 100 pound Kevlar). When the         shock cord is mounted outside of the tube like this, it is         necessary to cut a slot into the shoulder of any nose block         that may be used, so that when packed the shock cord will         not jam between the inside of the tube and shoulder.</P>                  <P>Not surprisingly, the shock cord should be able to absorb         shock. Elastic is good for this. For models of 4-6 ounces,         1/8" elastic is adequate, for heavier models 3/16-1/4"         elastic is better. The more length, the better the elastic         can absorb the shock when the chute deploys, but do not use         so much that the recovery compartment tube is crammed.</P>                  <P>Parachutes need to be able to be stored small, deploy         well, and hold up without ripping or losing shroud lines.         Cloth chutes are great for strength, but take far too much         room. Mylar chutes can be packed very small and tight, but         they can rip easily and sometimes do not deploy reliably.         Most commercial plastic chutes are suitable, but need to be         reinforced. For a 6-line chute, replace the 6 lines with 3         very long lines, and run them across the top of the chute.         Use extra tabs to secure the lines across the top near the         center. This ensures that no lines will pull out.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="pics/ChuteL.gif"><IMG SRC="pics/ChuteS.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=121 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <I>click drawing to see at twice size</I></CENTER>                  <P>Chute size is a judgment call. The larger the chute, the         softer the landing...unless it's so big that it gets jammed         inside and the model crashes! Smaller chutes cause harder         landings, but are more reliable. Experiment with packing         chutes in the tube you're using, if you are not able to blow         the chute out using lung power, go to a smaller chute or try         a different way to pack the chute. And remember this when it         comes time to fly, to pack the chute in the manner it         requires. Consider using more than one chute, it may be         easier to fit in 2 smaller chutes than one larger one, and         if only one opens the model won't crash.</P>                  <P>Given the above considerations, you've chosen a model and         are ready to put those ideas and your plans into action by         building, but will the conversion really work? Would you         like to know for sure it will work before building a         detailed pretty model? It's highly recommended to build a         "boilerplate" model first and find out. This means you         simply do just the flight conversion work to build a model,         don't paint it or worry about filling seams and so forth.         Then fly it, and see if it works. If it crashes, you saved a         lot of time and effort, and might be able to determine how         to solve the problem if you want to try again. If it works,         great, now you have the confidence to invest that time and         effort.</P>                  <P><B>Building Tips:</B> Plan out what order of assembly is         needed, you don't want to glue two body halves together and         then realize that you need to do something inside, like         mounting a shock cord.</P>                  <P>The engine mount tubes and other internal body tubes need         to be secured into the model. For a cylindrical plastic         model, custom centering rings can be made up, or if the fit         is close simply wraps of masking tape, then glue the tubes         to the model using the rings or gluing to the tape. For         other types, spacer blocks from balsa or spruce are needed         to hold the tubes in the proper position. Plastic cement         does not work well with wood or paper, so use cyanoacrylate         to bond the spacer blocks (careful not to let any run to the         outside of the model).</P>                  <P>Remove as much excess material inside as practical to         save weight, especially near the tail.</P>                  <P><B>Tools:</B> A razor saw is very useful for cutting         separation joints for models. A Dremel moto-tool can be used         with a cutting disc to remove large areas, where the disc         can fit into. As well, a grinding bit can be used on the         moto-tool for removing material more carefully and in         smaller spaces, and to remove internal obstructions such as         bulkheads and landing gear bays to allow a tube to pass         through. A small number of file shapes can also be handy for         shaping, rounding out smaller holes, or "deburring". For         some detail work, small drill bits turned by hand can be         useful, a pin vise can be used, or you can simply glue small         drill bits into 3" long 1/4" dowels, rounded at the top end         for low friction when pressing down.</P>                  <P><B>Finishing:</B> This article is mainly about how to         flight convert models, whole magazines are devoted on how to         actually build and finish plastic models. Some keys to a         good finish include neat glue joints, and the use of wet or         dry type sandpaper of increasingly finer grits to wet-sand         the seams and putty (Flex-I-grit sandpaper by K&amp;S is         best). Plastic putty can be used not only for filling seams,         but to blend and smooth trouble spots, particularly around         engine mount tubes if the body had to be cut to make it         fit.</P>                  <P>Use paints intended for plastic models, do not use dope!         Spray cans are typically used. An airbrush is nice but         overkill for many basic model's needs. If you want a flat         finish but will be using decals, use gloss paint(s) first,         apply the decals, then apply a flat clear coat. Otherwise,         decals applied over flat paint look "silvery" in the clear         areas of the decal. Anytime different paint types are used,         do a test first on some scrap plastic or other material.         Some paints are not compatible with other paints. Some clear         coats are not compatible and can even attack decals and/or         dry-transfers. If you plan to mask off colors, paint the         lighter color first. Let the paint dry and harden for a         coupe of days, then mask. Carefully applied scotch "magic"         tape can work well for some masking jobs. After applying the         2nd color, remove the tape mask about 30 minutes later,         before the new paint gets "hard", so the tape will come off         without bringing chipped flakes of the dried 2nd layer of         paint with it. Decals are best applied using a decal setting         solution, this not only can make the decal conform well over         any surface detail, but allows the decal to "slide" easily         into place (push the decal into place with a small model         paint brush).</P>                  <P>                  <HR>                  </P>                  <P>The above article includes several conversion examples         which are known to work. Pay particular heed to the listed         distance from the nose for the lengthwise CG locations. The         CG can be forward of the location shown, but not further         towards the rear. If you build a model of a different scale,         be sure to convert the CG location accurately.</P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Return to top </A><A NAME=plans></A><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Model Kits &amp;         Article</B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>Designer</B></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>Notes</B></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><B>QCR </B> - <A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/model.html">F-104         and F-100 jet conversion kits</A></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Ken Brown of <A HREF="http://cybertravelog.com/qcr/">Qualified         Competition Rockets</A></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>"All kits include the plastic model, tubes, shock cords,         weights for nose, launch lugs, parachute kit, instructions,         and plastic model conversion literature."</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P><A HREF="http://www.astre471.org/Newsletter/sd1999-0708.pdf">Plastic         Model Conversion article</A> from ASTRE's "Stardust"         newsletter, July/August 1999</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Jeff Vincent, article author</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="33%">         <P>Downloadable PDF issue, 3.6 megs.</P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><A HREF="anchor_rules"><A NAME="anchor_rules"></A></A></CENTER><P class=MsoNormal style="text-align:center">&nbsp;LastUpdated&nbsp;&nbsp;4/14/2004</P></BODY></HTML>
