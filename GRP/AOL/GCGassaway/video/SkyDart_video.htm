Cut out         a part of the left forward wing section which was melted and         spliced in a new piece of blue foam, then re-coevered that         area of the wing. Use 3.0" tubing from Totally Tubular to         replace the original 3" tube. Ran out of time to print and         add the "Astron Space Lines" decal and red stripe along the         body tube sides. Added additional wiring for a 5V regulator         to accommodate a 7.4V Lithium-ion pack to power a Gearcam. A         removable pod mount for a Gearcam was made up from ST-10         tubing and attached to the right rear fuselage, as seen         above. The SkyDart 2X's Gearcam was simply strapped onto the         left front fuselage looking back, using tape.</P>                  <P>For quite some time it seemed like no second pilot would         be found to fly the SkyDart, but Todd Juhrs of HARA         volunteered on Sunday. It took awhile to rig up the video         gear for the two cameras. Especially since to record the         second camera a VCR plus handheld TV had to be used, left at         the prep area several hundred feet away (while a camcorder         was more easily used near the pad area to confirm everything         was up and running and recording before launch)). It         requited a number of people to make it happen, in addition         to Todd there was Lynne Jones operating her husband         Steward's pointable hi-gain antenna for the SkyBooster, Ron         Witherspoon operating my pointable hi-gain antenna for the         SkyDart, and Steward Jones not only recording the flight         with his own camera (ground based, not airborne), but also         coordinating pre-flight to be sure the VCR set-up was         running properly.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Skydart/st05georgercglider2.jpg"><IMG SRC="Skydart/st05georgercglider2-t.jpg" WIDTH=121 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Pic by David Rowe</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?s=68c6b6b2717736bdaea1db4600d1b732&postid=190362"><IMG SRC="Skydart/OSP_Liftoff-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Pic by Stymie,<BR>                  from The Rocket Forum</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?s=f0311e8894cd8a6e749aa85c112e50ec&postid=190506"><IMG SRC="Skydart/OSP-Staging-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Pic by Rocketjunkie,<BR>                  from The Rocket Forum</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?s=68c6b6b2717736bdaea1db4600d1b732&postid=190363"><IMG SRC="Skydart/OSP_Glide-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Pic by Stymie,<BR>                  from The Rocket Forum</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Skydart/ST0577.jpg"><IMG SRC="Skydart/ST0577-t.jpg" WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  Pic by David Logan</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         After quite some time in prepping and getting all the video         up and running, the model was finally ready to launch. The         two G12's ignited well in the SkyBooster, and the model took         off with a nice climb rate, easy to correct on boost. At 6.5         seconds into the 8 second burn, I flipped the switch to         ignite the E9 in the SkyDart. Unlike the E6 air-starts of         NARAM-46, the E9 ignition was VERY obvious when the white         smoke appeared, and the higher thrust made the SkyDart         separate from the SkyBooster right away. I got to see a bit         of the SkyDart's flying but had to concentrate on flying the         SkyBooster. It was somewhat tail-heavy, making it tricky to         fly. I tried to set up a downwind leg to do a 180 to turn         into the wind but it lost a lot of altitude so I had to         forget doing a 180 and had to do a downwind landing. It got         into a large stall about 30 feet off the ground, fortunately         holding full up allowed it to keep the nose up so it was         level when it landed. Fortunately it suffered no damage.         Either I have to add some noseweight to it or arrange for         moving the R/C battery pack from the mid-fuselage top hatch         to near the nose cone.         <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Skydart/OSP_ST-sep.jpg"><IMG SRC="Skydart/OSP_ST-sep-t.jpg" WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  SkyDart view of Staging</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Skydart/OSP-sep2.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="Skydart/OSP-sep2-t.jpg" WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT>SkyBooster view of staging</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Skydart/OSP_ST-field4.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="Skydart/OSP_ST-field4-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT>SkyDart Glide &amp; parking area on                  ground</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Skydart/OSP-booster-field3.jpg"><IMG SRC="Skydart/OSP-booster-field3-t.jpg" WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  SkyBooster glide,<BR>                  field &amp; horizon view</CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <P>I got to see the last part of the SkyDart as Todd flew         it. It wasn't exactly the sort of model he'd flown before         but he was adapting to it. His piloting chore was made a lot         harder, as it was later found that one of the elevons was         moving more than the other elevon (very bad for any         delta-wing type model), something happened between its solo         flight on Saturday and the Orbital Skydart flight Sunday. At         the last moment the model was coming close to the large long         wheeled mobile sprinkler assembly (the site was a large sod         farm), he tried to avoid it which resulted in them model         hitting the ground at an angle. Fortunately there was little         damage, mostly cosmetic (It flew solo again at the         Birmingham Blast Off on May 21st).</P>                  <P>Both videos recorded successfully. Though there were some         signal dropouts from the SkyDart during glide. The SkyDart         pitched up pretty fast when it separated, so neither model's         camera saw the other model for long, just enough for a frame         grab. From the SkyDart's camera, it was seen that the model         rolled quite a lot during the boost, it was supposed to be         well-trimmed based on an E6 flight the SkyDart made by         itself on Saturday, but something happened from then to         Sunday'sOrbital SkyDart flight. In the SkyBooster video,         looking forward, the two right side launch tower rails can         be seen, especially the one nestled between the top of the         wing and the body tube. The little green flag seen flapping         around is attached to a "stopper" on a piece of surgical         tubing which is used for filling the water ballast tank. The         stopper and tubing are attached to an external umbilical on         the tower assembly, which disengages at liftoff to let the         water start dumping out (the water in the nose is to         compensate for the propellant mass of the two G12's. See the         <A HREF="../X1.htm">X-1 page</A> for more info on the water         ballast method). <A HREF="../../RBGliders/OSP/CIMG1513.JPG">This         photo</A> and <A HREF="../../RBGliders/OSP/CIMG1517.JPG">this         photo</A> from the Orbital SkyDart Project page shows more         on the water umbilical</P>                  <P>A surprise seen in both videos, especially the         SkyBooster's, is how the water ballast that is dumped from         liftoff, flowed onto the top of the wing and part of the         body tube. The dump port is at the "bottom" of the nose cone         (glide orientation), but then the wing top is tangent to         that side of the tube so maybe it's not such a surprise that         much water runs that way. After transition to glide, some of         the water can be seen flowing nearly parallel to the leading         edge of the highly swept forward portion of the double-delta         wing. Also, when the SkyBooster goes into that deep stall,,         the airflow noise suddenly gets scarily quiet (considering         the airflow noise the rest of the time), then "plop" it         lands and skids to a stop.</P>                  <P>The SkyDart video is 320 x 230 resolution, a <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/SkyDart/OSP-ST-Dart-CD.mov"><B>5.4         Quicktime movie</B></A></P>                  <P>The SkyBooster video is 320 x 230 resolution, a <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/SkyDart/OSP-ST-SB-CD.mov"><B>4.3         meg Quicktime movie</B></A></P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#99CCFF" WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <P><A HREF="../../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../gcghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>George's         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A>                  <P><A HREF="Video.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>To         VIDEO Page</B></FONT></A></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../NARshuttle/shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         Shuttle Model AOL Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../RBGliders/rbghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B>RBGliders         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
