It was         a mostly overcast day, though the sun broke out a few times.

The very draggy mount that pointed the camera         upwards, into a rotating mirror, and which also carried a 9         volt battery in the airflow, was replaced by a mount to         rotate the camera 180 degrees horizontally. The camera         inside is mounted to look a few degrees down rather than         perfectly straight back or forward. The rotating pod         consists of some modified 29mm tubing, a piece of Centuri         #10 tubing (to hold the Gearcam) and a couple of 30mm         vac-formed nose cones. One of the cones was painted black         inside and out to shield the camera from reflected light. It         was triggered by the same sort of retracting pin method as         before, driven by the flap servo. I had originally thought         of removing the flap servo and putting in some means for a         servo to directly (and slowly) rotate the camera pod 180         degrees, but that proved to be far more easily thought up         than worth working all the bugs out. <FONT SIZE="+2">         </FONT><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=200>                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Cuda_Gearcam_Pod_1.jpg"><IMG SRC="March_05/Cuda_Gearcam_Pod_1-t.jpg" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Cuda_Gearcam_Pod_2.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Cuda_Gearcam_Pod_2-t.jpg" WIDTH=101 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Cuda_Gearcam_Pod_3.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Cuda_Gearcam_Pod_3-t.jpg" WIDTH=132 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         The 9 volt battery as used before was replaced by a 7.4 Volt         (2 cell) 145 mAh Lithium-Polymer battery pack (though the         packs only have tested out to around 80-90 mAh). Each cell         weighs 3.5 grams, so an assembled 2 cell pack weighs about 8         grams. The Gearcam actually runs off of regulated 5 volts, I         modified my Gearcam to replace the original connector (which         has a small 5V regulator in it) and add my own 5V regulator         (7805 IC). I found out in testing that the Gearcam and the         model's R/C gear could not share the same battery source, as         the servo motion would affect the camera's video signal. So,         a second Li-Poly pack was used to power the R/C gear, with         another 5V regulator added. The two Li-Poly battery packs         weigh about the same as the 50 mAh Nicad pack usually used         for S8 type models like the Cuda, so the only electrical         increase in mass was due to the 5V regulators, about 3-4         grams grand total.</P>                  <P>The Gearcam weighs about 10 grams, and the rotating pod         mount weighs about 14-15 grams, so the net added weight to         the model is about 1 ounce, or about 28 grams, from when the         Cuda has been flown without the video system and using 50         mAh nicads. The rotating mirror mount and 9 volt battery         flown in February had added about 2.25 ounces to it, the         extra weight and extra drag could really be noticed in the         boost and in the reduced glide performance. With the new         rotating pod mount and Li-Poly batteries, the boost altitude         was much better and the glide was so much better that only a         stopwatch would have shown the difference between the new         Gearcam system onboard and flying the model "clean" without         it.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER><IMG SRC="March_05/Cuda_2Stage_2.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=66 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">C6 Staging</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P><B>Flight #1 -</B> However, it almost didn't get a chance         to show how well it boosted or glided. On the first flight,         using staged C6's, it pitched up and got out of control.         Unlike most R/C RBG's, the Cuda-Flap model's thrustline         produces a little bit of up pitch on boost, rather than down         pitch. Also, with the engine mount behind the CG, flying it         staged means it is particularly tail heavy at liftoff, so it         is more touchy until it stages. I had made some modification         to the transmitter programming the night before, and somehow         the boost mode/glide mode switch got it's programming         reversed. So, the model took off with significant up         elevator trim (meant for glide), and the servos were at high         rate (meant for glide) rather than boost elevator trim and         low rate. It ended up doing a loop, missing the ground by         about 20 feet or so. In the February videos, it had been         surprising to see how much the tailboom twisted. Well, on         this flight the tailboom twisted incredibly for a few         moments. After the boost ended it was hard to get the model         trimmed out, as I was trying to adjust glide trim while the         transmitter switch reversal meant that the "up trim" for         glide was not enabled. I did finally realize that for         whatever reason the up trim for glide was enabled with the         switch in boost mode, so left it there and finally landed it         safely.</P>                  <P>The video is of the boost only, 320 x 230 resolution, a         <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/March_05/Cuda_Wildboost_CD.mov"><B>1.1         meg Quicktime movie</B></A></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Cuda_C6_flt1_twist.jpg"><IMG SRC="March_05/Cuda_C6_flt1_twist-t.jpg" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">Tailboom twist during loop</FONT>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P><B>Flight #2</B> -After sorting through things in the         transmitter, the second flight was made on a single C6.

The flight boosted fine, and after sorting out the trims on         the transmitter it was realized the bird was actually a hair         tail heavy, so a bit of clay was added to the nose for the         rest of the flights.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=100>                  <CENTER><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Cuda_2Stage_2.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=66 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=left></B></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <P><B>Flight #3</B> - A good C6/C6 boost.

It boosted         nicely, and the video stayed good throughout the boost. Made         a bit of a roll correction during the boost, then decided         before burnout just to roll it the rest of the way, which         turned into a barrel roll transition into glide. During         glide, did some loops and barrel rolls. Unfortunately, the         camera pod didn't rotate to look forward, the rubber band         got hung onto a little piece of plywood near the retracting         pin on the fuselage. Due to the steady headwind, I made a         long landing approach that looked like the model glided a         lot slower than it really does. Tried to catch it, but it         ballooned up at the last moment. That would have looked so         nice if the camera was facing forward, but having read this         keep that in mind as you see the landing sequence in the         video.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/CudaE61.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/CudaE61-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">E6 boost</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/CudaE6_inverted.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/CudaE6_inverted-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Mid-Barrel                  Roll</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/CudaE6_field1.jpg"><IMG SRC="March_05/CudaE6_field1-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">A bit of sunlight</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/CudaE6_landing.jpg"><IMG SRC="March_05/CudaE6_landing-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1">Landing, about 10 feet                  up</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         The video shows from lifotff to landing, with some sections         cut out for time, 240 x 170 resolution, a <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/March_05/Cuda_E6_Shortened_web.mov"><B>2.8         meg Quicktime movie</B></A></P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>&nbsp;<B>Flight #5</B> - The last Cuda flight of the day         was on a D7 reload.

Strange. I         noticed on a few occasions in other boosts where the         tailboom seemed to move a bit from left to right, that         probably was the camera pod mount rotating a tiny bit. It         also seemed to occur a bit during some forward looking parts         of the glide, when pulling high speeds or dives. Some         tweaking of the rotating pod system seems to be in         order.</P>                  <P>The video shows from lifotff to landing, with some         sections cut out for time, 240 x 170 resolution, a <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/March_05/D7_dragrace_short_web.mov"><B>1.7         meg Quicktime movie</B></A></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Sunguidance</B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>Two Sunguidance flights were made. Now, Sunguidance does         not need the sun, in overcast skies the model will fly         generally straight up, biased a bit towards a brighter part         of the sky. But I wanted for the sun to be out to get the         desired flight paths. Fortunately, the sun did break though         on several occasions, though at varying intensity due to         haze.</P>                  <P>The <A HREF="Video_SEARS_Mar05.htm">Sunguidance flight at         the SEARS launch</A> was overcontrolled, the model         zig-zagged back and forth very quickly. That was partly due         to larger nose control fins, so a new set was made that was         the size of the most commonly flown previous fin sets. But         most importantly due to the Bertha type nose cone which had         the sides nearly parallel where the photoresistor sensors         are located. So, after only a few degrees or pitch or yaw,         one side of the nose cone would get shaded and therefore         drastically affect the movement of the nose section control         fins. So, that was simply fixed by replacing the Bertha type         nose cone with a Shuttle SRB type nose cone. That meant it         would not track the sun quite as sharply as before, but well         enough. It caused less movement of the control surfaces for         given amount of error in degrees, so it would tend not to         overcontrol . As would be shown in the flights and onboard         video, the changes made the model fly a LOT smoother.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="March_05/Sunguidance_Conical_Nose.jpg"><IMG SRC="March_05/Sunguidance_Conical_Nose-t.jpg" WIDTH=124 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">SRB type conical nose<BR>         (camera removed)</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><B>Flight #1</B> - Three stage, D12-0/D12-0/D12-7 (Chad         Staged). Have not used that engine combo a lot, but it is         about the most interesting, other than an E6. Fortunately he         wind was coming from nearly the same direction as the sun,         so when the model flew towards the sun it would be giving         itself more room to drift. Had the wind blown the opposite         way, I'd not have been able to 3-stage it without concerns         of drifting off of the field. The sun elevation was         something around 50-60 degrees at the time (made the         Sunguidance flights after the 3rd Cuda flight). The model         was aimed at about 30 degrees from vertical, downwind, and         opposite of the sun.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Sun1_3.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Sun1_3-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Climb on second                  D12</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Sun1_7_horizon.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Sun1_7_horizon-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Apogee, horizon leveled                  by Photoshop</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Sun1_10.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Sun1_10-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Twin                  chutes</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         At liftoff, it held the original launch angle, then started         to pitch to vertical, It staged just about at vertical, then         pitched more to lock onto the sun (well, the weak sun).

The         sun was out better for this flight than for flight #1. The         liftoff and climb was pretty much like the first flight.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Sun2_2.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Sun2_2-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Resumed climb after 3rd                  stage ignition</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="March_05/Sun2_4.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="March_05/Sun2_4-t.jpg" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Ejection</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         At burnout of the second D12, the D12-3, the model started         coasting. It nearly got to horizontal, but not quite, when         the D12-3 ejection went off to ignite the D12-7. When the         D12-7 ignited, the model then climbed back up towards the         sun. That pretty much followed what I had expected, I'd been         thinking about doing something like that before but with a         longer delay such as 5 seconds rather than 3. I'll probably         try that out later on, as well as adding an E9 sometime in         place of a D12.</P>                  <P>One of the chutes failed to deploy, but the model landed         safely on one 18" chute. Turned out the other chute was not         tangled, it needed more airspeed to make it pop open so had         the other chute not opened, that one probably would have.         This is why I use two chutes on models like that, they are         too important to use a single chute with.</P>                  <P>The video is from liftoff to chute deploy, 320 x 230         resolution, a <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/March_05/Sunguidance_2_Shortened_CD.mov"><B>1.8         meg Quicktime movie</B></A></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#99CCFF" WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <P><A HREF="../../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../gcghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>George's         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A>                  <P><A HREF="Video.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>To         VIDEO Page</B></FONT></A></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../NARshuttle/shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         Shuttle Model AOL Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../RBGliders/rbghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B>RBGliders         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
