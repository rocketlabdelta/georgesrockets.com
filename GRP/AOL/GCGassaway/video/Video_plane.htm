Wanted to check it out in the         air, so rigged it up to fly on my "Veet-1" Electric powered         sailplane. Above are a couple of frames (I think I forgot to         refocus it after doing some field of view tests aboard an         R/C R/G where I set it so the tail would be in focus).</P>                  <P>The flying site is one just west of Homewood. It used to         be a better place to fly before summer 2003 when the big         building at the lower left of the above image was built         (still no tenants).</P>                  <P>To the right are some pics showing the camera and battery         attachment on the Veet. The GearCam camera is both camera         and transmitter in one, the only other thing it needs aboard         the model is an 8 to 9 volt power source.</P>                  <P><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/GCGassaway/video/Electric_movie_1s.mov">Linked         here is a 2.1 meg Quicktime movie clip</A> of the sailplane         gliding around (it was a bit windy), finally coming in low,         then starting to climb back up (note the horizon angle tilt         due to the pitch-up of the climb).</P>                  <P>The range was pretty much as specified, around 600 feet.         Actually better at times, but there also was some breakup         even when closer as the antennas were not in the best         orientation (the receiver antenna was mostly end-on during         the approaches from downwind). So, I'll probably be going         for a 14 DB high-gain antenna for the wireless receiver.</P>                  <P>The sound of the Quicktime clip is odd, it's hollow and         tinny compared to the original. Something didn't come out         well in the conversion. Mostly what you'll hear is the sound         of the air flowing past the camera. When the model stalls,         the sound gets lower as it slows, then gets louder as it         picks up speed. When the electric motor cuts in, it really         makes a racket then. Sometimes you can make out a beeping         sound. That's something I added to the electric model to         warn me it was on, to try to prevent throttle-on         accidents.</P>                  <P>Of course, I didn't get this just to put in an electric         sailplane, this was just good way to try it in the air for         the first time. It'll be going into some rocket models for         sure.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="CameraSetup.jpg"><IMG SRC="CameraSetup-t.jpg" WIDTH=99 HEIGHT=120 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=160>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=250>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Camera attached to fuselage,                  looking out the right side.

Camera better focused. Set up with the camera         high above the wing, looking ahead and slightly down. Used a         14 DB hi-gain antenna to get better range. Put some tape         over half of the slots that let the microphone hear, to try         to reduce noise from air moving by. Also, by being pointed         forward, rather than sideways, there was less air swirling         so the sound during glide was better (easier to hear the         beeping).         <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Birmingham.jpg"><IMG SRC="Birmingham-t.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="WestLakeshore.jpg"><IMG SRC="WestLakeshore-t.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         The video frames above were taken at over 1000 feet, the         highest flight of the day.

A car happened         to be moving along a road during some of the flight, it         might look as if it was being tracked real-time, but it was         a coincidence (I'm not looking at the TV real-time).         <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/Jan-05/FlyBy.mov">Click         here</A> for Quicktime movie (1.5 meg).</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="roof0.jpg"><IMG SRC="roof0-t.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Roof1.jpg"><IMG SRC="Roof1-t.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=90 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Ron-P1100003.jpg"><IMG SRC="Ron-P1100003-t.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=106 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>         The day ended poorly. The model was flying along at about         400 feet or so when interference problems hit it. The         electric motor came on by itself, and the model started to         turn and dive by itself (the curved black horizontal dashes         in the video and frames are from the spinning propeller, a         sort of strobe effect). Came close to getting it to come         back, but the interference took over again and made it go         down towards a building. I wasn't sure if it went down in         front of, behind, or on top of the building. To make a long         story short....the videotape proved it was on top of the         building (Onboard camera's battery had died by the time I         was able to move the receiver/TV gear to the building for a         "live" shot). The next day, Ron Witherspoon of the <A HREF="http://www.birminghamrocketboys.com/">Birmingham         Rocket Boys section</A> got it off of the roof, using a         ladder arranged by BRB member Steward Jones. Much thanks to         Ron and Steward for thgeir help. As the video had indicated,         the model had pulled out near the end, hitting a glancing         blow and apparently bouncing/skipping for about 20 feet past         where it first hit. The only damage was that a control horn         had broken off from one of the V-tail surfaces. <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/georgegassaway/GRP/video/Jan-05/OnTheRoof.mov">Click         here</A> for Quicktime movie (1.6 meg).</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="ForwardMount.jpg"><IMG SRC="ForwardMount-t.jpg" WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=120 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=160>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=250>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Forward looking mount, above                  wing.</FONT></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=160>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Feb 19, 2005 </B></FONT>- Made a         flight at the Birmingham Rocket Boys launch.</P>                  <P>Objective was to get a shot of a rocket taking off, as         seen from the air.
