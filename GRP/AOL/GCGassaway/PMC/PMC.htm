Some models worked well; others                  "re-kitted" themselves shortly after launch. NAR                  members have an additional reasons for flight                  converting plastic models, because of the "Pink                  Book" Plastic Model competition event. This article                  is written mostly with competition in mind.</P>                                    <P><B>Model choice is critical</B>. The more the                  plastic model is like a normal rocket (with good                  fin area, room for noseweight, and plenty of room                  for the recovery system) the better the chances of                  a reliable safe flight. The Glencoe Models 1/48                  Jupiter-C is ideal for conversion, and is highly                  recommended for a modeler's first conversion (this                  was one of the earliest conversions from the early                  1960's when the model was made by Hawk).                  Unfortunately, almost all other rocket kits are not                  as easy. Jets are even harder, and some sci-fi                  space kits are almost impossible (Millennium Falcon                  anyone?). For competition, it is far better to                  choose something simple that is likely to work, and                  therefore qualify, than to try something harder                  that may have a better preflight score but crashes                  and is disqualified. Nobody wants to spend a lot of                  time and effort on a model that is likely to                  crash.</P>                                    <CENTER><A HREF="Juno_SaturnL.gif"><B><IMG SRC="Juno_SaturnS.gif" WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=166 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></A></CENTER>                                    <P>When considering models to convert, don't wait                  until the last minute. Look around and find out                  what kits are available. Your local hobby shop may                  not have a kit you have in mind but might be able                  to order it &emdash; ask them. Check out mail order                  suppliers in plastic model magazines; Squadron mail                  order is a good source. Countdown Hobbies also has                  a good selection of rocket/space plastic kits.</P>                                    <P>In Plastic Model competition, only models of                  space and sci-fi vehicles, and jets with engines                  near the rear of the fuselage, are legal (if in                  doubt, ask). Sorry, no flying converted Navy                  battleships or Ford Thunderbirds!</P>                                    <P>There are many key areas to consider for                  conversion, we'll start with the basic flight                  concerns starting with liftoff.</P>                                    <P><B>Mass and thrust:</B> The model won't go very                  high if it's too heavy for the engine it's flying                  on. Plastic models are generally heavy, and most                  require the addition of extra noseweight. Estimate                  the completed model weight, ready to fly, and                  determine what kind of engine power is necessary                  for the job based on other models of similar weight                  (and drag).</P>                                    <P>The thrustline should be through the center of                  gravity of the model, or very close to it. If not,                  the model will pitch over under thrust. Fortunately                  for "normal" rockets this is simple, the                  cylindrical body of a Saturn-V-type model means the                  center of gravity will be in the center of the                  body. The shuttle orbiter conversion shown in this                  article has a tendency to pitch nose-down at                  liftoff because the engine mount centering rings                  place the thrustline above the CG, not through it.                  It will launch OK if angled 10 degrees from                  vertical, on its back, so that it pitches toward                  vertical. However, it is best to make the                  thrustline go through the CG to begin with by                  cutting custom centering rings with the engine tube                  hole offset toward the CG location (in which case                  the orbiter could be launched vertically).</P>                                    <CENTER><A HREF="Orbiter.gif"><IMG SRC="OrbiterS.gif" WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=130 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                                    <P>Jet models have this kind of problem more than                  rocket models. The likely center of gravity of the                  completed model needs to be determined, then the                  engine mount must be glued in at the proper angle                  for the thrustline to go through the CG. One way to                  do this is to tape the model parts together,                  including any noseweight you plan to add. Insert a                  disk or bulkhead in the engine mount area with a                  string attached where the nozzle throat would be,                  then suspend the model nose-down. Sight down the                  string to see if the nose of the model points away                  from vertical; if so, note the angle. The                  thrustline needs to match this angle when the                  engine mount is glued in place.</P>                                    <P>Twin-engine jets have an even greater problem:                  Both motors must ignite at the same time or the jet                  may yaw at liftoff. If one motor fails to ignite at                  all, the model will certainly crash. Even the                  experts crash these models, so they are not                  recommended at all for early conversions. Some                  models, like the F-15, are well suited to run the                  engine tubes from the tailcones to the air intakes.                  However, jets like the F-14 and Mig-29 have                  CG/thrust mismatch problems &emdash; with those                  models the engine mounts must be aimed through the                  CG, then the internal tubing is "bent" with a                  coupler to angle down, allowing ejection out                  through the air intakes (similar to F-16                  conversion). If you really want to convert a                  twin-engine jet, but want to greatly improve the                  chances of success, consider adapting the model to                  use a single engine in the center. An example of                  this would be converting the SR-71 by cutting off                  the fuselage rear tailcone and putting an engine                  mount there instead of placing engines at the                  "real" jet engine locations.</P>                                    <CENTER><A HREF="F16L.gif"><IMG SRC="F16S.gif" WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=126 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                                    <P>A really nice tip from Kevin Kuczek is to use a                  small cheap keychain type laser pointer to help                  determine the alignment of thrustlines in difficult                  models such as jets. Mount the keychain laser                  centered in a manner that keeps it aligned inside                  the motor tube, then you can adjust the motor tube                  till the laser beam shines on the place near the                  nose that you want it to. It can take some                  creativity to be able to see where the laser light                  is shining inside. If there is a nose tip or                  anything up front that can be removed, temporarily                  remove it then place something translucent like                  paper across the opening, you will be able to see                  the light coming thru.</P>                                    <P><B>Stability: </B>Just about every plastic model                  needs some help to be stable. The easy way is to                  add noseweight (such as clay, or small lead fishing                  weights embedded in clay), which is fine for some                  models. For other models, the engine may not be                  able to lift any additional weight, or there may                  not be room to add noseweight; or the fins may be                  too small, or non-existent, so the fin area must be                  increased. You can get sheet plastic at most hobby                  shops; 0.04" styrene is a typical thickness to use.                  Models such as the Saturn-V can benefit from having                  the fins made somewhat larger; the old Estes kit                  used fins that were larger than scale. Since the                  contest event is "plastic conversion", and not                  "plastic scale conversion," you do have the leeway                  to make fins oversized even if it's out of scale.                  The "cardboard cutout" method can be useful in                  determining the Center of Pressure (CP), indicating                  whether the fins are large enough or if noseweight                  may be needed after all.</P>                                    <P>Some models that have no fins can use clear                  plastic fins; or you could choose to use normal                  opaque painted plastic. Clear fins are notoriously                  difficult to glue on neatly and mask off for                  painting. But if you choose to use clear fins, you                  can get the 0.04" clear plastic made by Plastruct.                  That clear plastic is a bit flexible; this is not a                  problem for small fins but can be for large fins.                  If flexing is a problem, try to find cheap clear                  plastic boxes to cannibalize for stiff clear fin                  material. Howeve,r one of the most ideal clear fin                  materials is Lexan (aka Polycarbonate). You can                  find 1/32" and 1/16" thicknesses of it sold by                  Micro-Mark. Do not use Cyanoacrylate to attach                  clear fins; not only does it not work well, but it                  often frosts up the plastic. Use a liquid plastic                  cement for bonding clear fins to the plastic                  kit.</P>                                    <P>If you have the skill to do it neatly, and if                  the model is suitable, you can use the slot and tab                  method with the clear fins. Cut the fins with a tab                  in the root meant to fit into a slot in he plastic                  model. And use great care in cutting out slots that                  are just exactly the width of the fin thickness, or                  maybe a hair undersize then file slightly wider as                  needed. Be careful aobut the use of liquid cement                  to gleu the fin in place. Mask off the fins very                  carefully so that paint won't creep onto the clear                  fin.</P>                                    <P>Also keep in mind that a model has to be stable                  in both pitch and yaw. If one were to convert a                  Klingon Battle Cruiser (something best left to                  experts) it might be stable in pitch but not in                  yaw, so rudder-like fins may be needed.</P>                                    <P>Some models with wings can be technically                  "stable" but pitch up (or down) due to a different                  incidence angle between the wings and tail                  surfaces. Check that the angle of attack of the                  wing and the horizontal tail surface (stabilizer)                  are the same. If the tail is at a different angle,                  the model is likely to loop into the ground due to                  the aerodynamic lift generated (the 1/32 Revell X-1                  has this problem). It will be necessary to attach                  the tail surfaces at a different angle of attack so                  that they are parallel with the wing angle of                  attack.</P>                                    <CENTER><A HREF="F104L.gif"><IMG SRC="F104S.gif" WIDTH=312 HEIGHT=100 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                                    <P>If you still have doubts about whether the model                  may pitch due to thrust or aerodynamics, you can                  make the model roll to help even out the pitch, in                  a "barrel roll" boost. This can be done by adding                  spin tabs to fins, or cutting &amp; gluing ailerons                  to make the model roll.</P>                                    <P><B>Ejection:</B> When the ejection charge fires,                  where it is going and where will the chutes be                  pushed out? In a simple conversion this is no                  problem; the engine mount tube can run all the way                  through the model, or it can be glued with                  centering rings into a larger tube for the                  parachute compartment. But, if the recovery system                  is going to come out at a different angle than the                  engine thrustline, the ejection charge needs to be                  ducted in some way. For a model like the F-16, it                  is possible to do a "bent tube" ejection by having                  the front of the engine mount tube join the rear of                  the recovery system's tube with one centering ring,                  glued at an angle instead of straight. For others,                  it could be more complex, using a tube that is                  ducted or even a series of tubes that do a zig-zag                  or a 180 degree turnaround to eject out of the                  rear.</P>                                    <P>No matter where the ejection charge is routed,                  the ejection heat does tend to damage the first 2-3                  inches of tube ahead of the engine (with composite                  motors there is some significant smoldering flame                  after ejection). The exposed areas can be protected                  by adding in a tube coupler or a layer of epoxy, or                  using thin CA soaked into the paper.</P>                                    <P>Some models may be suited for rear-ejection. An                  ejecting engine mount tube with centering rings                  glued to it, freely slides out of a larger tube                  plugged at the forward end. The recovery system is                  stored in the space between the outside of the                  engine tube and the inside of the larger tube. The                  ejection speed is high; sometimes shock cords snap                  trying to stop the ejecting mount tube. It is                  recommended to use separate chutes and shock cords,                  so that problem can be avoided (see the shuttle                  orbiter conversion).</P>                                    <P>Some models have no obvious or easy location for                  the separation joint which allows the parachute to                  eject; you may need to make your own nose section                  separation point. Wrap masking tape around the body                  as a guide and use a razor saw to carefully cut the                  body apart. This can be particularly useful for                  some jets (see the F-105), allowing complete                  cockpit detail to be used.</P>                                    <CENTER><A HREF="F105L.gif"><IMG SRC="F105S.gif" WIDTH=312 HEIGHT=154 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                                    <P><B>Recovery system: </B>It is important to have                  a good strong reliable shock cord and parachute                  system for the model. Plastic models are heavy and                  tend to stress the recovery system a lot at                  deployment. To keep the parachute compartment tube                  clear, try to mount the shock cord to the outside                  of the tube, but still inside the plastic model.                  One approach is to use flexible wire cable, secured                  deep in the model, with a looped end coming out at                  the front to tie the real shock cord to (see the                  F-105). Or, secure 50-100 pound test Kevlar line                  inside the tube, extending it out a few inches to                  allow shock cord attachment (Kevlar line is                  heat-resistant, but beware that for example D12                  type ejection charges will burn thru 100 pound                  Kevlar). When the shock cord is mounted outside of                  the tube like this, it is necessary to cut a slot                  into the shoulder of any nose block that may be                  used, so that when packed the shock cord will not                  jam between the inside of the tube and                  shoulder.</P>                                    <P>Not surprisingly, the shock cord should be able                  to absorb shock. Elastic is good for this. For                  models of 4-6 ounces, 1/8" elastic is adequate, for                  heavier models 3/16-1/4" elastic is better. The                  more length, the better the elastic can absorb the                  shock when the chute deploys; but do not use so                  much that the recovery compartment tube is                  crammed.</P>                                    <P>Parachutes need to be able to be stored small,                  deploy well, and hold up without ripping or losing                  shroud lines. Cloth chutes are great for strength,                  but take far too much room. Mylar chutes can be                  packed very small and tight, but they can rip                  easily and sometimes do not deploy reliably. Most                  commercial plastic chutes are suitable, but need to                  be reinforced. For a 6-line chute, replace the 6                  lines with 3 very long lines, and run them across                  the top of the chute. Use extra tabs to secure the                  lines across the top near the center. This ensures                  that no lines will pull out.</P>                                    <CENTER><A HREF="ChuteL.gif"><IMG SRC="ChuteS.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=121 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                                    <P>Chute size is a judgment call. The larger the                  chute, the softer the landing...unless it's so big                  that it gets jammed inside and the model crashes!                  Smaller chutes cause harder landings, but are more                  reliable. Experiment with packing chutes in the                  tube you're using; if you are not able to blow the                  chute out using lung power, go to a smaller chute                  or try a different way to pack the chute. And                  remember this when it comes time to fly, to pack                  the chute in the manner it requires. Consider using                  more than one chute; it may be easier to fit in 2                  smaller chutes than one larger one, and if only one                  opens the model won't crash.</P>                                    <P>Given the above considerations, you've chosen a                  model and are ready to put those ideas and your                  plans into action by building; but will the                  conversion really work? Would you like to know for                  sure it will work before building a detailed pretty                  model? It's highly recommended to build a                  "boilerplate" model first and find out. This means                  you simply do just the flight conversion work to                  build a model; don't paint it or worry about                  filling seams and so forth. Then fly it, and see if                  it works. If it crashes, you saved a lot of time                  and effort, and might be able to determine how to                  solve the problem if you want to try again. If it                  works, great, now you have the confidence to invest                  that time and effort.</P>                                    <P><B>Building Tips:</B> Plan out what order of                  assembly is needed, you don't want to glue two body                  halves together and then realize that you need to                  do something inside, like mounting a shock                  cord.</P>                                    <P>The engine mount tubes and other internal body                  tubes need to be secured into the model. For a                  cylindrical plastic model, custom centering rings                  can be made up, or if the fit is close simply wraps                  of masking tape, then glue the tubes to the model                  using the rings or gluing to the tape. For other                  types, spacer blocks from balsa or spruce are                  needed to hold the tubes in the proper position.                  Plastic cement does not work well with wood or                  paper, so use cyanoacrylate to bond the spacer                  blocks (careful not to let any run to the outside                  of the model).</P>                                    <P>Remove as much excess material inside as                  practical to save weight, especially near the                  tail.</P>                                    <P><B>Tools:</B> A razor saw is very useful for                  cutting separation joints for models. A Dremel                  moto-tool can be used with a cutting disc to remove                  large areas, where the disc can fit into. As well,                  a grinding bit can be used on the moto-tool for                  removing material more carefully and in smaller                  spaces, and to remove internal obstructions such as                  bulkheads and landing gear bays to allow a tube to                  pass through. A small number of file shapes can                  also be handy for shaping, rounding out smaller                  holes, or "deburring". For some detail work, small                  drill bits turned by hand can be useful; a pin vise                  can be used, or you can simply glue small drill                  bits into 3" long 1/4" dowels, rounded at the top                  end for low friction when pressing down.</P>                                    <P><B>Finishing:</B> This article is mainly about                  how to flight convert models; whole magazines are                  devoted on how to actually build and finish plastic                  models. Some keys to a good finish include neat                  glue joints, and the use of wet or dry type                  sandpaper of increasingly finer grits to wet-sand                  the seams and putty (Flex-I-grit sandpaper by                  K&amp;S is best). Plastic putty can be used not                  only for filling seams, but to blend and smooth                  trouble spots, particularly around engine mount                  tubes if the body had to be cut to make it fit.</P>                                    <P>Use paints intended for plastic models; do not                  use dope! Spray cans are typically used. An                  airbrush is nice but overkill for many basic                  model's needs. If you want a flat finish but will                  be using decals, use gloss paint(s) first, apply                  the decals, then apply a flat clear coat.                  Otherwise, decals applied over flat paint look                  "silvery" in the clear areas of the decal. Anytime                  different paint types are used, do a test first on                  some scrap plastic or other material. Some paints                  are not compatible with other paints. Some clear                  coats are not compatible and can even attack decals                  and/or dry-transfers. If you plan to mask off                  colors, paint the lighter color first. Let the                  paint dry and harden for a coupe of days, then                  mask. Carefully applied scotch "magic" tape can                  work well for some masking jobs. After applying the                  2nd color, remove the tape mask about 30 minutes                  later, before the new paint gets "hard", so the                  tape will come off without bringing chipped flakes                  of the dried 2nd layer of paint with it. Decals are                  best applied using a decal setting solution; this                  not only can make the decal conform well over any                  surface detail, but allows the decal to "slide"                  easily into place (push the decal into place with a                  small model paint brush).</P>                                    <P>This article includes several conversion                  examples which are known to work. Pay particular                  heed to the listed distance from the nose for the                  lengthwise CG locations. The CG can be forward of                  the location shown, but not further towards the                  rear. If you build a model of a different scale, be                  sure to convert the CG location accurately.</P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <P
