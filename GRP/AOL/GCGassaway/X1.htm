See also the <A HREF="SCALE/X1/X1_draw.GIF">assembly         drawing</A> which is on this web page and the pictures of         the nose assembly and fuselage subassemblies above.</P>                  <P>The X-1 model has a scale factor of 1/10. Diameter of         5.4", length of 37", span of 36", Wings just a bit bigger         than scale, for a wing area around 165 sq in (150 would have         been scale).</P>                  <P>All-wood construction. Nose section built-up using round         formers and 24 stringers, with 24 3/16" balsa "planks" glued         across the stringers. The 24-facet cross-section was sanded         to a round cross-section. Center fuselage also built up, but         a very simple frame with bulkheads, skinned by 1/8" balsa         curled to shape. Rear section was a straight cone made up of         3/32" balsa curled similar to how paper &amp; cardboard         transitions are made. Some 3/16" balsa was glued inside the         lip of the slightly oversized large end of the tailcone so         when sanded down there was a 2" curved transition instead of         a sharp break. Not quite the right rear fuselage shape, but         practical and light.</P>                  <P>Wing was also based on balsa construction, with 1/16"         wing skins, and using a Bob Parks BP-3d airfoil. The wing         had a 5.75" span center section that glued into the fuselage         mid-section, the outer panels of the wing plugging into the         center section using telescoping fiberglass tube joiners and         music wire alignment pins.</P>                  <P>Wing control surfaces consist of what were flaps on the         real X-1 (going out about half-span from the root). On the         model, those flaps were used as flaperons, moving both as         flaps and as ailerons. More recently the flap capability has         been taken out, they act only as ailerons.</P>                  <P>The horizontal tail section was built to be all-moving, a         "flying tail". That simplified making the tail removeable         for transport, slipping the two halves and their joiner rods         from the bellcrank inside thehollow fin/rudder assembly.</P>                  <P>Power by 32mm reloadable motor, as used by the Aerotech         "Phoenix" Rocket Boosted Glider. For G12 and F13 power.         Might do an F16J someday but the endburners are more my         speed.</P>                  <P>The burnoff of the propellant would cause a VERY         significant shift in the CG due to the far aft locaiton. To         compensate for this, a vac-formed water ballast tank was         added as far up front as possible. It held 90 grams of         water. With a fill/drain line and a vent line. At liftoff         the drain line came unplugged to allow the water to drain         out by gravity-feed. Tank is fully drained about 4-6 seconds         into positive-G glide after a G12 reload.</P>                  <P>Final details of the model were that the upper and lower         ventral system tunnels were made out of vac-formed plastic.         The finish of the model was primarily by using orange         Towerkote iron-on covering. The lower ventral tunnel was         painted using a color-matched paint by Monokote. I wish I'd         painted the upper tunnel too, as the Towerkote produced some         bubbles that would not go away.</P>                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="SCALE/X1/X1_decals.GIF" WIDTH=429 HEIGHT=139 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P>The big Stars &amp; Bars markings were mostly cut-out         trim monokote, plus some red decal stripes that Ed Lacroix         added. The decals for "Glamorous Glennis", "Bell Aircraft",         and a few other markings were done in MacDraw (much traced         from scans of X-1 kit decals Alex Seltsikas did for me) and         color printed. The color print then was used as a master in         a color xerox machine to print onto some high quality clear         water-decal film tom Campbell gave me info on (From         Micro-Mark). Obtaining the decal material and printing them         was described in more detail earlier this week in the thread         about how to make decals.</P>                  <P>The model's mass turned out to be around 30 ounces in         liftoff mode on a G12, 25 ounces for glide (5 ounces lost by         water dump and propellant burnoff).</P>                  <P>Now, when I planned building this a few months ago, it         was going to be "for fun", to sport fly at NARAM. But part         of the way through building it, I started to think about         entering it in sport scale at NARAM. It actually was a dumb         thing to do if our team wanted to score well, the Little Joe         II has a good track record, while the X-1 would not score         well in static. But in helping to run NARAM this year, our         team wasn't flying as "seriously" as we usually do. Ed         LaCroix agreed it seemed like a neat thing to do this year,         so we decided to use that for Southern Neutron's sport scale         model after all.</P>                  <P>Indeed it didn't score up there in static, 5th place.</P>                  <P>On to the flying. Ed LaCroix assisted getting the bird         ready to fly from the tower, as we loaded the water ballast,         plugged in the battery pack, and popped the canopy in place.         At launch it took off out of the tower straight. But it had         a bit more up trim than it should have, it pitched up near         vertical and I had to use full down to keep it from going         beyond vertical onto its back. It also had a roll that I let         go while working the pitch control . Finally settled down         into a glide, as it stalled somewhat due to the trim still         being off. Got it sort of trimmed, and also trimmed out a         roll to one side. Finally ready to land, trying to land on a         real dirt runway at the NARAM site. Coming in just fine,         then put the flaps down and... it pulled to the left. The         flaps didn't deploy symmetrically. Landed safely, but missed         the runway.</P>                  <P>OK, so it was planned to be one flight. But that flight         wasn't satisfying. So, quickly it was ready to fly again.         This time with downtrim added, and aileron throw reduced (it         had been sensitive in roll on glide). The launch was very         smooth, as though on rails. Pulled a bit of up to bring the         final climb angle ot around 60 degrees, and corrected a bit         of roll. So it was a very smooth easily controlled boost.         Altitude was around 500 feet. Never even felt the difference         when the last bit of water ballast drained out, it felt good         in glide off the bat. Still a bit sensitive still in roll         during glide, so I went back to the boost low rate for         aileron throw. Did at least one very large racetrack         pattern, maybe two, before going to the far end of the         runway to set up for landing. Got there with lots of         altitude, so did a couple of 360's to burn it off, might         even have been able to use a 3rd. Got it on line and came in         to land... and it kept on going. Had expected to land 50-100         feet in front of me, but it flew 50-75 feet past (flaps         would have helped there to shorten the slope but after the         first miscue, they were not going to be used for the 2nd         flight). Fortunately landed on the dirt runway anyway... but         not with much room to spare. No idea of the glide time, just         it was a lot of fun (once it finally got into the air).</P>                  <P>It scored some nice mission points, moving it past the         previous 3rd and 4th place static models. Unfortunately, the         1st and 2nd place models, John Pursley's (Jekyll &amp; Hyde         Team) huge Saturn-V (around 1/66 scale, 60" tall), and Mark         Bundick's (All the President's Men Team) nicely built         Atlas-II both crashed, so the X-1 ended up taking 1st place         in the Team division.</P>                  <P>The model has flown 7 more times since then, 3 at Muncie         (US Team flyoffs) and 4 at a later Birmingham Tripoli         launch. One of the last flights was timed, for about 2:15,         though that was probably with a bit of a thermal assist.</P>                  <P>Sadly, the X-1 literally crashed and burned at NARAM in         2000. The take-off was unusual and I tried to do a loop to         get it to enough airspeed to be controllable, but it hit the         ground a glancing blow, knocking the G12 engine mount loose.         The still-thrusting G12 caused the balsa tailcone to burst         into flames. Everything aft of the wings was destroyed in         the fire. It might be rebuilt someday.</P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#99CCFF" WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="gcghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>George's         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../NARshuttle/shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         Shuttle Model AOL Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../RBGliders/rbghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>RBGliders         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
