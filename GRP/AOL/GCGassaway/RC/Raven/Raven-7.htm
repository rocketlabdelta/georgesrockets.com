It was the first R/C R/G to be designed for the         Aerotech E6 engine, which Bob had worked with Gary         Rosenfield to develop. Bob and his wife Karen Dillon flew         Ravens, Karen taking the Bronze medal at the 1983 WSMC (Phil         Barnes using a Dark Star-5 to win the gold), and the US team         had the top team score.</P>                  <P>Bob shared the plans with others. Ben Roberto made his         own series of Raven models. At right is an overview plan of         one of Ben's Raven models.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>In early 1992, Bob Parks designed the Raven-7. It was         like his earlier Raven designs, but was scaled up to 60"         span to be flown on 32mm reloads such as the F13 and G12. It         was intended to be a second R/C R/G kit by Aerotech, but         unfortunately it was never kitted. While it was still a         prospective Aerotech kit, Bob asked me if I'd be interested         in building the second prototype, to give feedback for the         instructions. Of course!. It was a nice model to build, I         had not even built a Raven style model before. Was a nice         flying model, would have made such a nice kit for an F or G         powered model. It was a bit heavy, as Bob wanted the wing to         be able to hold up to an F23 boost, and the 1/2" fiberglass         tailboom was pretty much bulletproof.</P>                  <P>I ended up using it in G R/G at NARAM-34 in 1992, using         an F10 and D12 that lit about 1 second into the boost (The         G12 reloads were not contest certified at the time). That         flight went pretty well. Second flight was an F10 with a         second F10 intended to ignite about 1 second before the         first F10 burned out. The second one ignited about 4 seconds         into the first F10 burn, causing an incredible acceleration         till the first 10 burned out, so it was a good thing that         wing was "F23" rated after all. Have flown Raven-7 a few         times since, though not since 1999. It boosted best when         using and G12 and E6 clustered, flew that way a few times at         NSL-99 in Huntsville.</P>                  <P>Click here for a <A HREF="Raven-7.gif">50% drawing of         Raven-7.</A></P>                  <P>The Raven type layout may be familiar to those who never         have seen it before. Kevin McKiou's "Knightstar" was         strongly influenced by the Raven design. And Kevin's 'Cuda         kit looked even more like a Raven (at least when a 'Cuda is         built with the "T" tail option).</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=220>         <CENTER><A HREF="Raven_150.gif"><IMG SRC="Raven_150-t.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=160 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A>Raven         150 by Ben Roberto                  <P><A HREF="RC_RBGs_1992.JPG"><IMG SRC="RC_RBGs_1992_s.JPG" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=93 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Raven-07 (top)<BR>         with other models in 1992</P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#99CCFF" WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <P><A HREF="../../../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME=top></A><IMG SRC="../../../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../gcghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>George's         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../../NARshuttle/shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         Shuttle Model AOL Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../../../RBGliders/rbghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>RBGliders         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
