The SkyDarts as rudder-only R/C, BT-50 sized. To help carry         the extra weight of the radio gear, the wing area is         enlarged a bit to 110%. The prototype used a small GWS 4         channel receiver, pico servo, and 50 mAh nicads (total         prototype SkyDart glide weight, 69 grams). There's lighter         radio gear out there, but it's what I had for a sport         project like this (I might use this project to help nudge me         into trying out Li-Poly battery packs, since the final         SkyDart models with paint and covering will weigh more than         the prototype airframe).</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A crude prototype was built (just one         SkyDart), and an old finned BT-55 model was pressed into         service. It was test-flown at the December 18th         </FONT><A HREF="http://www.birminghamrocketboys.com"><FONT SIZE="-1">Birmingham         Rocket Boys</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"> launch. It was hoped         it could boost straight enough without another SkyDart on         the other side, but that wasn't the case. It arced on its         back and went far downwind on boost. After that, a third         BT-55 tube section was added, the launcher was tilted more         into the wind, and the rudder was held full over to help         make it roll on boost. The boosts were safe but went into         the wind a lot, cutting the potential altitude and ejecting         well after apogee. But the flights achieved the main goal,         to see how well the model glided and how well the rudder         control worked out given that the SkyDart lacks         dihedral.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Turned out it had far more rudder control         response than it needed, so the rudder throw was dialed back         in the transmitter.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Next step will be to build another         SkyDart, improving the radio component layout, covering the         wing and tail in a lightweight model airplane covering, and         painting the body and nose. Then the two will be flown to         work out the kinks more, that should boost a lot straighter.         Lastly, another SkyDart will be built, using another color,         to replace the bare balsa rough prototype.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This project is called "SkyDart Twins",         as a nod to the old Estes plan #41, "</FONT><A HREF="http://www.dars.org/jimz/eirp_41.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1">Space         Twins</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1">", from the late 1960's.         That one had two Orbital Transport-ish gliders mounted         opposing each other to balance it out (this plan pre-dated         the Orbital Transport, so the O.T. actually based its glider         on the Space Twins gliders). I never built the Space Twins,         but in 1970 or 71 MPC had a kit of a similar type of design,         two piggybacked gliders called "</FONT><A HREF="http://plans.rocketshoppe.com/mpc/mpcR-215/mpcR-215.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1">Lunar         Patrol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1">", which was one of my         first successful glider models. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">I did a twin R/C glider project before,         the </FONT><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/RBGliders/Robart.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1">Robart         UFO twin piggybacked gliders</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"> in         1999. It worked out nicely. But it needed an F for each         flight. And was a bit much to ship to NARAM in addition to         other models so I only had it at one NARAM. The SkyDart         Twins will be a lot cheaper to fly and a lot easier to         transport.</FONT></P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;<A HREF="SkyDartLayout.gif"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="SkyDartLayout-t.gif" WIDTH=146 HEIGHT=41 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         Prototype R/C layout</FONT></P>                  <P>&nbsp;<A HREF="brb-PC180003.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="brb-PC180003-t.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=267 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=top></FONT></A></P>                  <P><A HREF="BRB-Dec21180m.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="BRB-Dec21180-t.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=126 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-2">Ron Witherspoon photo</FONT></P>                  <P><A HREF="BRB-Dec21185m.jpg"><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="BRB-Dec21185t.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=93 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-2">Ron Witherspoon         photo</FONT></P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC" CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD>         <CENTER><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/RBGliders/rbghome.htm">To         RBGliders main page</A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD>         <CENTER><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/gcgassaway/gcghome.htm">To         George's Rocketry page</A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD>         <CENTER><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/narshuttle/shuttlehome.htm">To         Shuttle model main page</A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
