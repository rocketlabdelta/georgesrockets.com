The UFO is         sort of like a blended-body hybrid of a flattened lifting         body with sort-of regular outer wing, except it has an         "alien" style of design appearance to it.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">The F-16         was a bit too big and the F-117 a bit too tricky to do the         rudder-only piggyback conversion. I chose to use the UFO         design to convert to rudder-only R/C, adding a removable         fin/rudder to the top. Installing the radio gear itself was         pretty easy, cut a hole just the size of the servo into the         top of the "body" and jammed the servo into place, with a         hole running down to run the servo wiring. The servos used         for both gliders were old Cannon super-micro servos,         nowadays there are a nubmer of 1/2 oz or less servos         available cheaply.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">The         receiver (Hitec 555 micro) is mounted into the belly, into a         rectangular hole cut into the foam. Same for the 50 mAh         nicad battery pack. Glide weight of about 6 ounces.         EACH.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Why         each? Too tricky to work up a good way to piggyback a glider         with this size and mass, and not as much fun either, so two         were converted to fly on opposite sides of a piggyback         booster. One painted orange so the pilots could tell which         was which.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">The         booster is 56" of BT-70 (Totally Tubular), ejecting in the         middle, plus a BMS BT-70 nose cone.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">First         flight was on an F22J-5 reload. Unfortunately it turned out         to be too long of a delay and ejected late, and into the         sun. So, the flight was successful but not very long. And         right after that flight Gene Hornbuckle, who was the pilot         for one of the gliders, had to leave (Gene is a very         experienced R/C sailplane flier as well as rocketeer). His         replacement was SEP program manager Greg Warren, who had         never flown R/C before. Well, this is also part of what this         is about, something for newcomers to try to fly. But it was         a bit windy so there was potential for an unpiloted or badly         piloted model to glide far far off, fortunately Greg had         done R/C cars before so he had experience with the "coming         at you" steering reversal problem (if the model is coming         your way and you want it to go to your right you have to         steer it left).</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">The F25         took it to about 600 feet, ejecting at about 500 feet. The         nose-down dive of 100 feet meant the gliders had a lot of         speed when they pulled out at ejection, so they both peeled         away in opposite directions and after a couple of stalls,         settled into glides. Greg had no problem at all controlling         his, and for most of the flight we flew in formation, or         about as much in formation as rudder-only allows. Greg         landed within 100 feet of the launch site. Flying         time...unknown, but probably along the lines of 90         seconds.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">So, the         model(s) worked out just great, as hoped. The "Robart fleet"         will be flown at NSL and NARAM.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">If         someone is interested in building their own, let me know for         more details.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Another         exciting thing about this Robart series is that later in the         year when they come out with 3 more foam gliders, one is         supposed to be a shuttle orbiter. That orbiter will likely         be similar in size to the 1/60 piggyback R/C orbiter I fly,         which has a span of 18". All these Robart foam gliders have         a span in the 16.5 to 18" range.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Pictures         at right courtesy of Ronny and Greg Tipps of Waverly,         Tennessee.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Unfortunately,         Robart does not list these gliders o n their web page.

The dark line just left and trailing behind it is         the 1/32" music wire pushrod that attaches to a control horn         on the rudder.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">The red         fin/rudder is made of balsa, and attached in a removable         fashion for transport purposes.

I had hoped it         would be possible to do two different gliders but the whole         model pitched to one side during boost, and would have         crashed if not for a slow roll. So, only two identical         gliders should be used. </FONT></P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Photo at         Right courtesy of Greg Warren of the SEP program.</FONT></P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><IMG SRC="Robart/Robart_UFO_Closeup.JPG" WIDTH=361 HEIGHT=597 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=275>         <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A different kind of model, a Zagi         flying wing.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Zagi is a 48" span R/C slope         combat glider. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This one was convertedto boost on         rocket power, using F13 and G12 reloads.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is quite aerobatic, thanks to         its use of full-span elevons.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;To find out more about the         Zagi flying wing, go to the</FONT> <A HREF="http://www.zagi.com/Home/home.html">Trick         R/C (Zagi) home page</A></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Photo         courtesy of Ronny and Greg Tipps of Waverly,         Tennessee.</FONT></P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><IMG SRC="Zagi/Zagi_Glide.jpg" WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=320 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica">&nbsp;</FONT><A HREF="#top">Backto Top</A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#993300"><B></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#99CCFF" WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../GCGassaway/gcghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="../NARshuttle/shuttlehome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"><B>George's         Shuttle Model AOL Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="25%">         <CENTER><A HREF="rbghome.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>RBGliders         AOL Home Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
