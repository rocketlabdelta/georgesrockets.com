The         outline drawing by Dan Joyce showed an X-20 looking a bit         simpler than the later version people are more familiar         with. That outline drawing also showed the windscreen, no         jettisonable cover was indicated.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">The colors         and markings were extrapolated from a combination of a crude         artists conception but mostly based on the pattern of the         Gemini-Titan, with appropriate use of US Air Force insignia         and lettering.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">Model is         scaled at about 1/46 scale, a BT-80 (2.6") diameter body,         32.6" long. To make it fly stably and straight, it used 6         ounces of noseweight to make it balance ahead of the 1st         stage/2nd stage interface. See </FONT><A HREF="X20/X20_Titan2_model_drwg.GIF"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">model         assembly drawing</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">         at bottom. In case of nose up or nose down lift by the X-20,         which would have made the model tend to loop, the fins were         angled slightly to make the model roll. This was proven out         first by building a smaller scale BT-50 boilerplate with a         very crude non-gliding X-20, and deriving a worst-case CP         using Tom Beach's CP portion of his Rocket Stacks to         determine how much noseweight to use. The boilerplate flew         straight up, no problem.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">X-20 was         built out of balsa sheet. The outline was cut for the bottom         fuselage out of 1/8" balsa and vertical formers glued into         place. Light and easily curled 3/32" balsa was used to make         up the fuselage sides and top. The nose section was done in         a similar manner, two sets of curved balsa sheeting to match         the two different slope angles, as well as a solid tip         sanded to shape. Holes in the formers allow for the X-20 to         fit atop a BT-20 extending from the Titan adapter section.         The X-20 was built for the elevons to pop up for glide, held         down flat by the BT-20. For a finish, the X-20 was covered         in black Towerkote (goes well around curves) and sprayed         clear flat after decaling.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">The adapter         was built from .02" plastic sheet. Complicated cross-section         change from the fuselage of the X-20 to the round body of         the Titan. Location of X-20 centerline compared to Titan         body also makes the adapter eccentrically off-center. See         the drawing at below right. Noseweight added to the BT-20 to         extend the noseweight as far forward as possible.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">Titan body         made from BT-80, actually Totally Tubular's 34" long BT-80.         Separation point just ahead of the top black roll pattern.         Fins built up from .02" plastic.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">Markings -         The X-20 US Air Force and USAF white lettering was made by         Tango Papa decals. Stars and bars on the wing and Titan         taken from old kit decals. US Air Force black lettering and         simulated rectangular/semi-oval openings were homemade         decals, clear sheet run thru a photocopier. The simulated         opening wraparound decal however had some flaws, the toner         started to flake off a bit.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">Black roll         markings were a problem. I normally use Microscale's black         solid color sheet, but they no longer make them and this         model wasn't important enough to justify using what little I         have left. I used some old Sig solid color black decal, but         it was fragile and 2/3's of the rectangles cut out cracked         or tore. But finally they were done. But after drying they         dried with wrinkles in many spots. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">The "coup         de grace" for a string of finishing problems was in applying         the clear flat coat to the Titan. The clear flat I wanted to         use (Model Master) happened to attack the aluminum paint         used (fortunately I tested it first). And Krylon's clear         flat made decals stand out terribly, they made the clear         film look a bit frosty. So I used Microscale's clear flat,         which comes in bottles and needs to be airbrushed on.         Unfortunately I didn't test that (why, I don't know). It         seemed to be OK but after awhile some white specks showed         up, some of the clear flat had "spit" out and made the         specks show up. Tried to clean it off, it's water-based, but         it had dried too much to clean off and just smeared. I've         never had a model go through so many problems in the         painting/finishing phase. </FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">The flight         was on an E15-4, launched from a 6' C-rail. I let it fly at         a bit of an angle into the wind for concern of how much it         would drift downwind, as there were trees about 400 feet         downwind. But it weathercocked a pretty good bit too, and it         rolled quickly, needed only about half the roll angle in the         fins. The weathercocking caused it to be pretty close to the         ground at ejection (under 100 feet?), but the recovery         system held up OK (twin chutes on the main body and twin         chutes on the heavy nose section, each chute with its own 6'         long 1/4" elastic shock cord). The X-20 came off, did a         couple of stalls, and settled down into a quick         glide.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#000000">Took second         place in team division at the Mick Wilkins meet, beaten by         one point!
