But refined it somewhat for the 40mm version.</P>                  <P>The heart of the tower is the Base Cylinder, which holds         the rails aligned. The Base cylinder has fillets that match         the surface of the rails to hold them in alignment, so that         the only thing necessary to attach the rails to the cylinder         is to simply tape them using electrical tape or vinyl tape.         It's not "elegant", but it works well.</P>                  <CENTER>\<A HREF="Rockettower/Tower_Assembly.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/Tower_Assembly.jpg" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=175 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                  <P>The tricky part is fabricating the cylinder. Ideally it         would be a tube that is the perfect diameter to hold the         rails just far apart for a loose slide fit of the model         without being too loose. I wasn't able to find such a         perfect fit of tube. What I used was BT-60, with some         tweaking. Now of course BT-60 is not stiff enough to hold up         to such a task, and neither would the perfect tube for that         matter. The tube needs reinforcement inside. For the BT-60         that was somewhat easy to do. First, I glued a piece of         Totally Tubular (Jim Fackert) I used some Estes BT-20 to         BT-60 centering rings to help place a BT-20 inside. One ring         was slid about 1.5" inside, the other just barely inside so         as to just align the BT-20. Thick CA was dribbled inside the         end with the 1.5" recess to help to seal off that end so         nothing would leak. Then, I got out some old Alumilite that         was too old to cast good parts with, but still useful for         filling bulk volume. I mixed up enough to pour in and fill         the 1.5" recess. This is why the recess had to be sealed         well, so Alumilite would not leak inside. After that cured         rigidly, then the centering ring at the other end that held         the BT-20 was removed. Then more Alumilite was mixed up to         fill the rest of the void. The strength was overkill, if I         was doing it again with fresher good Alumilite I'd add some         filler to the middle mixes since only the last 1.5-2&Oacute;         or so at the ends really need to be sturdy.</P>                  <P>So, that produced a good sturdy stiff cylinder, but the         BT-60 was a bit too thick. I peeled off a lot of the outer         layers of the BT-60, but the peeling did not produce enough         of a reduction in diameter. So I ended up doing some sanding         with a sanding block at three places 120 degrees apart to         get the desired diameter. That was a crude way to do it, not         ideal, but that's what I ended up with. If I did it again, I         might try making a very thick-walled fiberglass tube on the         aluminum mandrel, using some 1.5 oz. cloth or many layers of         3/4 oz. cloth, to be sure the tube would be large enough in         diameter and relatively sturdy to be able to do the same         thing as done with the BT-60 regarding filling it with         resin.</P>                  <P>With the cylinder of the right diameter, the last thing         was to give it fillets to align the rails. That was done by         using two special styrene discs with holes at the exact         spacing needed for the desired diameter. I drew up a pattern         in MacDraw for the center lines of the holes, and rubber         cemented the pattern to some styrene so the holes could be         made.</P>                  <P>With the two discs at either end of the rails, with the         cylinder inside, the rails were checked to be sure they were         parallel to each other with no twist. Five Minute epoxy was         dabbed along the cylinder and the rails to produce the         beginnings of a fillet. I could only do two fillet sides at         a time. After the first six fillets were done, then I         followed up with some more epoxy to make the fillets larger.         After allowing a very long cure time, then it was time to         remove the rails from the cylinder. Well, that was a         problem. I had used vinyl tape so the epoxy would pop off,         but the epoxy stuck a bit better than I expected. I did         finally get the rails off, but in the process broke parts of         a couple of fillets. Fortunately the fillets still were fine         for aligning the rails, so I just left them that way. If I         did it again I'd apply a lot of mold release on the rails         where the fillets were created.</P>                  <P>Once that was done, a test assembled it by laying the         rails in place and wrapping with tape. Just fine, nice solid         assembly, sturdy, and fast (no bolts!).</P>                  <P>That's not to say the tower was done, but that was the         most important part.</P>                  <P>The main rails are 40" of .505" fiberglass tubing. The         upper rail extensions are 25" making for a total tower         length of 65"</P>                  <P>12" of .414" tubing are used for joiners. A little bit of         mylar tape is used to help get a bit snugger fit.</P>                  <P>The fiberglass rails can be found at some of the better         Kite Supply vendors. Such as: <A HREF="http://www.kitebuilder.com/inventory/epoxy.htm">Kitebuilder.com</A>         and <A HREF="www.goodwindskites.com">Goodwindskites.com</A>.</P>                  <P>The top ring is always a problem for towers. However, I         already had one, an adjustable one I used for an older 30mm         tower made similar to this one. The tower top ring dates         back to a design I used for a top ring in 1978, made out of         spruce and using some telescoping brass square tubing with a         good friction fit for adjustment. The spruce top ring itself         is 6-sided, three bolts and wingnuts hold the 3 pieces         together, so the top ring can be disassembled for transport.         Also the brass/music wire spacer rods are removable too.         That's not to say I might not want to get hold of a better         top ring for the WSMC, but this one worked fine.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Rockettower/Tower_Ring-1.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/Tower_Ring-1-t.jpg" WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=256 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A>                  <P>                  <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="75%">                  <A HREF="Rockettower/Tower_Ring-2.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/Tower_Ring-2-t.jpg" WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=299 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></P></CENTER>                  <P>The tower is attached to the Omni-Pad by bolting one of         the rails to the pad. Due to the piston, some of the rail         length is not used for guidance, so there is no problem by         attaching bolts to the side. Besides, the tower is more         rigidly attached that way than a bottom attachment. I did         originally think of attaching via the side of the cylinder,         but attaching via the side of a rail was simplest.</P>                  <P>To be sure that the tower rail will not rock side to side         when bolted to the pad, I made up an interface piece out of         balsa. Some 1" wide 3/8" thick balsa that has two 1/2"         pieces of triangular balsa glued side by side, the triangles         oriented inwards so that there is a 90 degree "V-notch" as a         result.</P>                  <P>To help keep the rails from bending apart near the middle         of the tower, one of the two styrene discs used for the         fillet process is also used. The disc is located a few         inches below the top of the piston head. The ring has a 1/2"         hole in it, which works fine with 11mm pistons.</P>                  <P>Speaking of pistons, the tower was designed from the         start with piston use in mind. That is why the tower is so         long, since the piston takes up so much length.</P>                  <P>The reason for the BT-20 cast inside of the base cylinder         was to give a good universal means for attaching a piston to         the tower. Any sort of attachment can be made up and simply         plugged inside the BT-20.</P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <P>Now, there is one mistake I made, in retrospect.                  To get maximum use of the tower length, I decided                  to interface the piston in such a way that the                  lower few inches of the piston tube itself fit down                  inside. In theory, that was great. In practice, it                  was a problem. The fiberglass tubing core of the                  piston assembly was free to slide, too free to                  slide. When I set up a model in the tower, I                  lowered it onto the ignitor protruding from the                  piston head, and then while holding the model dead                  still, slide the piston tube up to fit over the                  bottom of the engine. Well, what ended up happening                  was that due to fiction, the core of the piston                  also slid up with the piston tube, and sometimes                  crushed the ignitor. What I need to do is to change                  the interface so that the core can be firmly                  anchored so it can't accidentally slide up.</P>                                    <P>In the photo at right, the first image shows the                  model with piston at the bottom position, and                  second image view shows how much tower guidance is                  left when the piston fully extends and the model                  leaves the piston.</P>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Rockettower/OmniPad_Tower.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/OmniPad_Tower-m.jpg" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=300 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>                  <P>The way the tower sits relatively close to the ground,         there is enough room to be able to put the model into the         tower without tilting it or using a chair. For someone         shorter, that could be a problem. The first line of defense         would be to mount the tower even closer to the ground, and         indeed if I needed to I could have made it sit almost         touching the ground.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></P>                  <P><A NAME=omni></A><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Omni-Pad</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Every tower needs some way to hold it in place and adjust         the launch angle. Some like the Apogee/Medalist tower have         their own legs. Most others use a separate device to hold         thew tower, such as a Tripod or pad.</P>                  <P>Too often the camera tripods are not sturdy enough. Often         they wobble in the wind with a tower attached. In enough         wind, the solution has been to add a sting to act as a guy         wire to prevent the tower from blowing around too much.         That's an on the field band-aid, not a really good solution.         You can't easily change the angle to counteract         weathercocking since the guy wire isn't easy to adjust, and         if there are three towers all using the guy wire method in         the same pad area, eventually you know what's going to         happen.</P>                  <P>So, here's some info on the pad I use. I call it         "Omni-Pad" since it is used to holding all kinds of launch         devices. C-rails, R/C RBG towers, Pistons, and Contest type         Towers. I won't get into extreme detail, however.</P>                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE="+3" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099"><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="32%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Rockettower/OmniPad_Tower.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/OmniPad_Tower-tb.JPG" WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="32%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Glider_Tower/Tower_and_pad.JPG"><IMG SRC="Glider_Tower/Tower_and_pad-tb.JPG" WIDTH=86 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="32%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Rockettower/Shuttle-N41-gaff.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/Shuttle-N41-gaff-t.jpg" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="32%">                  <CENTER>Omni-Pad with Contest Tower</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="32%">                  <CENTER>Omni-Pad with Glider Tower</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="32%">                  <CENTER>Omni-Pad with C-Rail<BR>                  <FONT SIZE="-2">Rick Gaff photo</FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></CENTER>                  <P>Basic design criteria was that it be able to break down         easily for transport, and not require any tools to assemble.

For 1996, version I made         up a new lighter version breaks down into parts no longer         than 30" and I can fit one inside a suitcase. It is made up         of 3/4" square Aluminum tubing and 5/8" wood dowels. The         Aluminum tubing is used for the main parts. The 5/8" dowel         is used for extending the pad out for a larger footprint,         for the front leg and outer legs. The dowels simply slide         inside of the aluminum tubing. A threaded insert in the         dowel and a hole in the aluminum tubing allows a thumb-screw         to be used to secure each dowel in place.</P>                  <P>The pad needs two diagonal struts for support. The         lateral (side) strut keeps the pad from wobbling about the         yaw axis. I use some "U" cross section aluminum extrusion         for that, but it could be anything suitable.</P>                  <P>The most important diagonal strut is the one for         elevation. The lower end of it attaches to one of several         6/32 threaded rod at specific places along the forward 5/8"         dowel (The 6/32 rods are really just 6/32 screws with the         heads cut off, and CA'ed into the dowel). They are located         in places that result in 90, 85, 80, 70, 60, and 45 degree         elevations. Of course since the Omni-Pad was mostly meant         for R/C use, the exact angle did not matter much. But it has         been a bit of trouble when used for ballistic rockets.</P>                  <P>For the flyoffs I changed that strut to one using a         turnbuckle so the elevation angle could be adjusted several         degrees. The turnbuckle uses 3/8" threaded rod. It was         grafted to some fiberglass tubing to act as a joiner between         the threaded rod and dowel with a hole at each end. You can         see in the photo below what it looks like.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Rockettower/OmniPad_Turnbuckle.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/OmniPad_Turnbuckle-tb.JPG" WIDTH=116 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                  <P>The angle is adjustable backwards too. When there's a lot         of wind, it is useful to be able to tilt the tower AWAY from         the wind so that as the model weathercocks it will         weathercock vertical, and hopefully not weathercock much         into the wind. Depends on some events as to how important         that might be.</P>                  <P>To help keep the pad from blowing over, the front leg is         staked into the ground. A very large screw eye is attached         to the front end of it, so a large 3/8" nail can be used to         stake it down. Since I face the front end into the wind, it         does not have to be staked elsewhere. If the wind changes,         the pad normally is just pivoted around the staked front         end, though in a tight space if need be the front end gets         re-staked.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Rockettower/OmniPad_Tower.jpg"><IMG SRC="Rockettower/OmniPad_Tower-tb.JPG" WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>                  <P>Now, there's all kind of ways to make pads and towers and         so forth. I don't expect to see exact clones of the Omni-Pad         or this tower. But there are some parts that folks might         want to consider doing with their pads and towers.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom><FONT SIZE="+3" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000099"><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="50%">                  <CENTER><B>Also see the </B><A HREF="Glider_Tower.html"><B>R/C                  Rocket Boosted Glider Tower</B></A><B>                  Page</B></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Glider_Tower.html"><IMG SRC="Glider_Tower/Tower_and_pad-tb.JPG" WIDTH=86 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Glider_Tower.html"><IMG SRC="Glider_Tower/Bigbird_boost-t.jpg" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT><IMG SRC="../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom></P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="../graphics/GRP-1.jpg" WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=59 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=60>         <P><A HREF="../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><A NAME=top></A><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="33%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="Glider_Tower.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>To                  Glider Tower Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="33%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="RocketTower.html"><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFCC00"><B>Pad                  &amp;  Tower Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="33%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="PadTower2011.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>To                  2011 Pad &amp; Glider Tower                  Page</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P></CENTER><P></P></BODY></HTML>
