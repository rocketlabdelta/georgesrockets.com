Unfortunately, the                  R&amp;D files were lost on a bad hard drive, so the                  report text itself and some drawings were lost.</P>                                    <P>The R&amp;D report focused on the adjustable                  aspects of the tower design. So that a wide variety                  of models could be flown off of it. This is notable                  since most R/C RBG's require a special rail                  configuration that only tends to work with that                  model, or model VERY much like the one the tower                  was built for.</P>                                    <P>In the years since that report, a number of                  other R/C RBG Fliers have made up their own                  versions of this tower, and sometimes their own                  versions of the Omni-Pad as well.</P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="50%">         <CENTER><A HREF="Glider_Tower/g-P8050016.jpg"><IMG SRC="Glider_Tower/g-P8050016-t.jpg" WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=250 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Four Cuda R/C R/G's in Towers at NARAM-43 in 2001</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT><IMG SRC="../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom><TABLE WIDTH="75%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="70%">         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>The first time I ever saw a R/C Rocket Boosted Glider use         a tower was at the 1980 WSMC in Lakehurst, N.J.</P>                  <P>Bob Parks used a tower to launch his "Eagle" class (D/E         power) R/C Boost Glider. Bob, along with Bernard Biales, had         come up with the idea, and the way the model took off was         very impressive. Over time, the Glider Tower idea caught on         with other fliers as well.</P>                  <P>I originally used launch rods for my early R/C Boost         Gliders, and even my first R/C Rocket Gliders. But those had         issues with binding the rod, and even more problems in wind.         In 1986, I decided to get serious about doing R/C R/G, with         a new dedicated R/G design (Synchronicity), instead of         kludged modifications of old B/G models. To go with that, I         also built a Tower. That first tower used 3/4" diameter         aluminum tubing and shelving rails for tower rails, plus a         very beefy built-up base to mount everything together. It         was mounted to my first Omni-Pad, which itself was pretty         heavy as it used 1 x 2 wood. The tower worked well, but it         was an awful lot to transport to NARAMs and WSMC's. Also,         that tower had been built to work with Synchronicity. It was         not adjustable however, other than adding in some shims to         vary for wing thickness, nothing more.</P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Adjustable Tower:</B></FONT></P>                  <P>I originally used launch rods for my early R/C Boost         Gliders, and even my first R/C Rocket Gliders.

In 1986, I decided to get serious about doing R/C R/G, with         a new dedicated R/G design (Synchronicity), instead of         kludged modifications of old B/G models. To go with that, I         also built a tower. That first tower used 3/4" around         aluminum tubing for the two main rails and shelving rails         for the upper wing rails, plus a very beefy base to hold         everything together. It was mounted to my first Omni-Pad,         which itself was pretty heavy as it used 1 x 2 wood. The         tower worked well, but it was an awful lot to transport to         NARAMs and WSMC's. Also, that tower had been built to work         with Synchronicity. It was not adjustable however, other         than adding in some shims to vary for wing thickness,         nothing more.</P>                  <P>In the early 1990's, I came up with a new design to use         an adjustable tower head. Made from 1/2" particleboard, with         slots to allow for the inner rails to be moved to allow for         fuselage width. And by use of long screws and special         spacers, it could b configured to be used for a wide variety         of designs. Ed LaCroix made several of those, for his own         use and made some spares that were sold to a few other         fliers who were interested.</P>                  <P>As with the Omni-Pad, one of the key design elements was         not to need any tools to assemble or adjust the tower. So,         the tower uses 6/32 bolts, with wing-nuts, or thumb-nuts so         the tower could be assembled and mounted using only one's         hands.</P>                  <P>The tower rails were adopted from ones that had already         been used by other U.S. member for their R/C R/G towers and         Contest Model towers. Rails made of .505" fiberglass tubing,         with joiners made of .414" fiberglass tubing. It is         surprising the number of people who have seen those black         resin fiberglass rails and assumed those were highly         expensive graphite tubes.</P>                  <P>The fiberglass rails can be found at some of the better         Kite Supply vendors.
