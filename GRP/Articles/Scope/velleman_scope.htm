That is a pixel resolution         of about 28 pixels/degree to 22 pixels/degree. If the scope         is set to 10 millivolts, then range plotted would be around         4 to 5 degrees, with pixel resolution of about 14         pixels/degree to 11 pixels/degree.</P>                  <P>The project is still a work in progress. No field or         flight testing yet. Among other things, I need to get the         right kind of BNC connector for building a cable to hook         between the Scope and the Thermistor Circuit box, rather         than use the test leads. Also long permanent leads for the         thermistor. And to rig up a "holster" for the scope to fit         into, the holster itself to be mounted to a thermal pole. It         will use a typical sunshade for the thermistor, a 3"         diameter disc of foam with chrome trim monokote on the top         and sides of the foam disc to reflect sunlight (The photo of         the thermistor circuit black box shows a bare thermistor on         very short leads as soldered up for bench testing).</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=250>         <P ALIGN=right><A HREF="Velleman_circuit.gif"><IMG SRC="Velleman_circuit-tb.gif" WIDTH=215 HEIGHT=174 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P><B>NARAM-46 update:</B></P>                  <P>The scope was used for the first time to pick air for         models, at NARAM-46. It worked out well, using the 30         sec/div setting (6 plus minutes plot, with one pixel per 3         second updates).</P>                  <P>Testing at home had indicated that direct sunlight could         make the screen overheat and go dark, so a sunshade assembly         was made out of .04" styrene plastic to provide some shade.         The Oscilloscope itself was held inside of a big ziploc bag,         allowing access to the pushbuttons. The screen was not too         easy to read inside of the bag, so a rectangular hole (at         screen level) was cut into the bag and a piece of flat Lexan         was taped to the bag along the edges of the hole. It was         then very readable, though over time (and the high humidity)         the tape let go. A more permanent solution is needed. A         holster type case is made for the scope, I wish I'd bought         it when I got the scope but the shipping cost is a bit         prohibitive to do it now.</P>                  <P>The thermal pole the scope mounted to was itself attached         to a special post that was taped to the pole using vinyl         tape. The post has a bracket at 90 degrees, near the bottom,         allowing a person to "step" onto it to push the post into         the ground by foot. So, the pole was very easy to move from         one pad area to another, rather than needing to use a hammer         to pound the post into the ground each time it was moved. I         found the post at Target for $12 in the garden department,         with a decorative "hook" at the top. The upper part with the         hook was cut off, leaving the post about 3.5 feet long. And         the blunt bottom end was sharpened into a two-sided wedge to         make it easier to push into the ground.</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=250>         <CENTER><A HREF="CIMG1384.JPG"><IMG SRC="CIMG1384-t.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         (photo by Chris Taylor)</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/GRP-1.jpg" WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=59 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=60>         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><A NAME=top></A><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../Articles.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to Articles</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../thermal.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to Thermals</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
