The method described here allows         making custom rings that are consistent once the correct         radius has been determined for the arc-scribe tool.</P>                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="Pins.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=83 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="SingleScribetool.gif" WIDTH=301 HEIGHT=103 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P>The scribing tool is essentially a crude custom         beam-compass for each desired inside or outside tube         diameter. A piece of spruce 1/4" tall and 1/2" wide is         suitable for the beam. The pivot point is a pin such as a         map pin or round-headed pin (as used to put notes on a cork         board), about 1/32" diameter, protruding about 1/4" from the         bottom of the spruce beam.</P>                  <P>The scribing pin needs to be located at just the right         distance away from the pivot pin to produce the desired tube         radius. Whatever the tube's inside or outside diameter is,         divide by two and that is the distance you need. However,         the exact fit is rarely obtained on the first try, test         first by scribing out (explained later) the desired ring or         hole in some scrap material then compared to the tube.         Relocate the scribing pin hole as needed until the test         scribes produce a ring or hole with a good fit. Once the         right location for the hole is confirmed, use Cyanoacrylate         (CA) to help secure the pins into the spruce so they can't         work loose. It can help to use some rough sandpaper or a         file on the body portion of the pins to give the CA a good         surface to bond to. The scribing pin's point should protrude         from the spruce beam bottom by about 1/16".</P>                  <P>For each scribing tool you make, mark on it what tube it         is for, and whether inside or outside. If you know you'll         make a lot of rings of one type, make up tools that will         scribe both circles for the ring at the same time. So         instead of using one tool to scribe a circle for the inside         of a 1.64" diameter tube and then use another tool to scribe         the outside of an 18mm tube, you can scribe both at the same         time.</P>                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="DualScribeTool.gif" WIDTH=394 HEIGHT=191 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P>Once you get a certain diameter of scribing tool just         right, you can use it to help make dual arc-scribing tools         to produce a particular centering ring set. Say you want to         make a dual scribing tool to make a centering ring to mount         a BT-50 inside of a BT-80. Drill a small hole into the new         dual arc-scribing tool, to be uses later for the pivot pin.         Then take a scribing tool for the outside of a BT-50, insert         its pivot pin into the new dual scribing tool you are         making, and scribe an arc towards one end for the BT-50 tube         hole to be scribed. Then do the same thing using a BT-80         inner Diameter scribing tool., towards the other end. Then,         drill a hole into each of those two arcs, and insert and         glue the pins into all of the holes. Remember to mark the         new dual arc-scribing tool for what tube sizes it is used         for.</P>                  <P>This method works great on plastic sheet and plywood up         to 1/16" thick, in a pinch it can do thicker plywood, but         there is an alternative for thicker rings which will be         covered later. For most model rockets, 1/32" ply most model         rockets, 1/32" plywood is fine for rings. Since this method         works best of all with plastic, it is preferable to make         rings out of plastic such as .04" sheet for uses where         plastic is acceptable. Obviously plastic is NOT acceptable         for a top centering ring of an engine mount, as it would be         subject to melting from ejection heat, for other uses such         as centering rings for a nose sections's paper shroud it's         fine.</P>                  <P>After deciding which material to use for the ring, make a         pinhole into the material that is greater than the large         radius of the ring you are making. Put the scribing tool's         pivot pin into the hole. Press down onto the scribing tool         while rotating it, to scribe circles into the material.         Rotate enough times with adequate force to scribe almost         halfway through. Then, flip the material over and scribe the         other side about halfway through. You can decide whether or         not to scribe even more to break through to the other side         or to simply flex the material back and forth to cause the         plastic or plywood to fatigue enough to pop free.</P>                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="scribe.gif" WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=130 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P>If you use a scribing tool that cuts both the inner and         outer radiuses at the same time, always apply a bit more         pressure to the outer radius area so that whenever the ring         pops free it will be the outside, and not the inside hole.         If the inside hole pops free first, you won't be able to         easily use the scribing tool to cut the rest of the outer         portion of the ring.</P>                  <P>That is essentially all there is to making rings by         scribing. Now that you know how to make basic rings, there         are some other tricks you can do. As referred to before,         this method cannot make thick rings. Not one single thick         ring. But, if you want a 1/8" plywood ring, you can make two         1/16" plywood rings and glue them together (cross-grain) to         make one strong 1/8" ring.</P>                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="SandwichedRings.gif" WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=120 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P>The multiple ring method also can be used for making         stiff rings that are strong but also light. Make up two         plywood rings of whatever thickness would be suitable, then         make a thick balsa ring - using one of the plywood rings as         a guide for cutting out with a model knife. Glue all three         together to create one very thick, stiff, strong, yet         relatively light ring.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>This method also is practical for cutting rings with         multiple holes as used for clustered models. You first         scribe out just the outer portion of the desired ring. Draw         a straight line across the ring, running through the center         pinhole, as a reference line for a 2-engine cluster. Using a         compass pivoting in the center pin hole, make short arcs to         mark the center location for the cluster tube holes to be         scribed from, then make pin holes in those arcs to define         the pivot points for the tube holes to be scribed out.</P>                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="2EngineCanterCluster.gif" WIDTH=512 HEIGHT=171 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>                  <P>Also shown in the 2-engine example is how to mark off two         different pairs of pivot point locations so that a bottom         centering ring could have the tube holes farther out than         the holes in the top ring. Why do this? The result of that         would be to cant the engine mount tubes inwards, so their         thrust lines come closer to the center of gravity of a         clustered model, so it is less affected by uneven ignition         of the cluster. The example shown for 2 engines works for         any cluster combination, as long as there is room in the         model's main body to space the engine tubes that way.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>For more than 2-engine clusters, mark off more reference         lines from the center of the main ring, spacing all the         lines the same angle apart (# of outer holes / 360). For         example a 7 engine cluster with 6 outer engine tubes, make         the lines 60 degrees apart from the center. Determine the         radius location for the center pivot point of the outer         tubes, mark off the radial arcs, then put 1/32" pinholes         into each location. You may want to do the above with a         plastic ring instead of plywood, and save the plastic ring         to use as a template - that way you don't have to mark off         every complex ring you want to make, just use the plastic         ring as a guide to transfer every complex ring like this         that you want to make, just use the plastic ring as a         pattern guide to transfer the pivot pinholes to the material         you plan to cut the real rings from.</P>                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="66%">                  <CENTER><IMG SRC="7engineCluster.gif" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=162 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="33%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../../Scale/DATA/George/LJBoilerplateCluster.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><IMG SRC="../../Scale/DATA/George/LJBoilerplateCluster-t.jpg" WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Helvetica"><B><BR>                  G25 and six C6's with canted<BR>                  thrustlines in Boilerplate                  model</B></FONT></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="66%">                  <CENTER></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="33%">                  <CENTER></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P></CENTER>                  <P>If you really like this method you will end up with a         number of different arc-scribing tools, so save them in the         same place such as a drawer or parts bin box. &nbsp;<BR>         </P>                  <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_1125.jpg"><IMG SRC="IMG_1125-t.jpg" WIDTH=271 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="IMG_1152.jpg"><IMG SRC="IMG_1152-t.jpg" WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=200 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER>Rocket Frisbee with Canted and SKEWED<BR>                  Thrustline to cause spin</CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>      </TD>      <TD NOWRAP WIDTH=10 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="15%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="15%">         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=10>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="70%">         <CENTER><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A>                  <P></P></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH=10>         <P></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="15%">         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/GRP-1.jpg" WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=59 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=60>         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><A NAME=top></A><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../Articles.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to Articles</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <P></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
