Every minute, taking a reading from a digital thermometer.         It ended up being more of a distraction than a help. So in         winter &amp; spring of 1988, I worked up a homemade chart         recorder. The idea was not new for thermal picking, I had         read some articles about F/F model airplane fliers who had         done so, and even ran across plans for a couple of really         simple ones. I really had to learn more about electronics         though, since it would need Op-Amps to amplify the weak         voltages being produced by a thermistor in a Wheatstone         bridge (temperature) and a small DC motor acting as a         generator (anemometer). A big hurdle also was passed when         Art Rose provided a Servo tester circuit to use for driving         the servos for the pens. Once I learned enough about how to         use that servo circuit and the increased knowledge on         Electronics (thanks to Forrest Mims' Radio Shack books),         that led to another spin-off project, Sunguidance.</P>                  <P>The first version of the Chart recorder used a wind-up         clock to drive a drum with paper on it (one of the F/F model         plane recorder articles had used that method). I would tape         down three or four layers of paper, and once an hour peel         off one layer so it did not over-write he previous layer.         That was annoying enough, also the clock drive was pretty         wimpy and fragile. But otherwise, the recorder worked out         well for trying to find lift.</P>                  <P>I quickly found that normal pens would not work. They         needed too much pressure applied to work properly. A felt         tip marking pen would work ,but it left a very thick trace         and would dry out too quickly. I finally tried a BIC         "Roller" pen, and it worked great. So, that is what I used         ever since. </P>                  <P>The anemometer was made up of a 3 volt DC motor that acts         like a generator when turned. The one used was a good one         that made more voltage for a given rotation rate than some         others I had tried. The motor did not have a lot of         friction, but in order to be able to get the anemometer to         work well even in low winds, the anemometer used larger cups         (Leftover vac-formed Little Joe II Apollo BPC cones) and set         up on longer beams than one would usually expect for an         anemometer.</P>                  <P>A year or two later at a local HAM radio show, one of the         vendors had old computer printer paper drive mechanisms for         sale. I got one, then went about trying to work out how to         run the thing at a reasonably slow speed (shooting for a         rate of about 1" of paper movement per 5 minutes). The         solution was to get a Stepper motor Experimenter's kit from         All Electronics. That allowed being able to set the stepper         motor to any desired speed, and even to run it backwards if         need be to re-set the paper. However, the stepper motor did         not have quite enough torque to run the paper drive         reliably. So, a reduction gear was needed. I found a cheap         wind-up toy train whose gearbox was enough, something around         9:1 ratio. So, in the end, the stepper motor worked out well         for driving the paper. It did need some extra battery power,         as it not only needed 12 volts, but used several amp-hours         worth to run for a full day. Fortunately though that could         be provided by leftover Gel Cells not being used as launch         batteries.</P>                  <P>I had taken the chart recorder to a couple of NARAMs but         had not used it much since it involved so much to set it up         and use it. I'd used it at a few local regionals at first         too, but more for practice with the recorder as eventually I         stopped taking it to regionals. Well, the main reason for         building it was for US Team use at WSMC's anyway. It was         used in 1989 for the US-USSR Exchange meet at Wallops         Island, and at the WSMC's from 1992 thru 2000. It was quite         useful on many occasions.</P>                  <P>Unfortunately, it has been finicky at times in simply         running or not running. I was not good at soldering when I         made the circuits of the main control box in 1988, and         didn't use shrink-wrap tubing. Over time, the wiring got a         bit flaky. Sometimes, a hit to the box was enough to get it         going again. Sometimes it was more than that.</P>                  <P>Before the 2002 WSMC, I did what I could to find bad         wiring inside the main control box, at least what I could         find and fix short of getting rid of everything inside and         starting over. Also, the recorder assembly was given a bit         of an overhaul by mounting it inside of a cheap briefcase.         Unfortunately, at the 2002 WSMC, the recorder would not         operate right at all. In retrospect, it may not have         mattered if it had run, as it was so cold for most of the         duration days that it may have been below the temperature         range the thermistor Wheatstone bridge could handle (I had         found it bottomed out at around 55 degrees of so when         testing it in 1988 but figured it would never be used in         conditions that cold. Then who expected a WSMC to be held in         mid-October). Fortunately, a laptop based Chart recorder         developed by James Duffy &amp; Andy Tomasch was on hand, so         the team had some use of a recorder, though it had its own         practical problems (screen visibility outdoors and battery         life).</P>                  <P>I plan to make a new control box for my recorder, which         will mean junking everything about the old control box.         Making all of the circuits brand new, with better soldering         skills, heat-shrink, better wiring, and better planning         since the old 1988 control box and circuit boards were made         up.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="35%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;<A HREF="Recorder2.jpg"><IMG SRC="Recorder2-t.jpg" WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=220>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top>                  <CENTER>Chart Recorder in Briefcase (2002)</CENTER>                                    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">(set up for testing at home,                  with anemometer &amp; thermistor sensors in                  background.

You can see the temperature and wind         plots (there were a few rapid off-scale jumps in the wind         plot that was a recorder or servo issue, not the real wind).         In general, when the temperature starts rising, and the wind         starts decreasing, there may be a thermal upwind. In the         example shown, marks and names were written in to indicate         when a person's model was actually launched.</P>                  <P>I also once tried to work out a remote station to add         upwind temperature and wind sensors. Which is why when the         recorder was modified for a stepper motor paper drive         system, there was room alotted for more servo pens to be         added. I was trying to use the same Op-Amp circuits as the         main recorder, with the output into a 75 MHz "ground" R/C         transmitter, where a 75 MHz receiver would be used with two         servos on the paper drive. Unfortunately the RF output of         the transmitter fed back into the relatively weak signals of         the temperature and wind sensors, making it useless. No         amount of shielding could fix the problem.</P>                  <P>On a not very windy day that varies the wind direction a         lot, usually thermals are causing the wind shifts, "sucking"         ground level air into them. It's a lot easier to try to pick         lift when that happens, though days of very low wind that         allows the wind to vary in direction so much from thermal         activity does not happen frequently enough. For a long time         I wanted to add a 3rd sensor, a wind direction sensor, but I         still haven't come across anything with the right mix of         fine resolution and ability to actually point accurately in         low winds (very low friction weathervane pivot), that might         make such a wind direction plot as useful as theory         indicates it might.</P>                  <P></P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="35%">         <CENTER>&nbsp;                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A HREF="Chart3.gif"><IMG SRC="Chart3-t.gif" WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=150 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A><BR>         Chart Plot from 1996 WSMC (Slovenia)<BR>         S4B Boost Glide flights of Dave O'Bryan,<BR>         Phil Barnes, and Ben Roberto</P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><IMG SRC="../../graphics/bluebar4.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=bottom><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="64%">         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A nearly ready-to-use Temperature         recorder</B></FONT></P>                  <P>Jim Fackert had the idea of using a portable         Oscilloscope, with a simple B&amp;W LCD screen, as a thermal         chart recorder. It has several limitations, such as         resolution, displaying only 6 or 12 minutes of data (with a         corresponding plotting delay of 3 or 6 seconds), and only         showing one channel unless you pay a lot more for a         2-channel version. But it's a lot easier to set up and use,         a lot more portable, and a lot more reliable. It does         require making up a relatively very simple sensor box in         order to produce a usable voltage output from a thermistor         in a Wheatstone bridge, but it's not hard to make up the         sensor box (A one night project). This LCD oscilloscope         based recorder is portable and easy enough to set up to be         practical to take to NARAM and other meets. <A HREF="../Scope/velleman_scope.htm">For         more info on it, use this link.</A></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="35%">         <CENTER><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/gcgassaway/Scope/velleman_scope.htm"><IMG SRC="../Scope/P1010009-tb.jpg" WIDTH=204 HEIGHT=141 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/GRP-1.jpg" WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=59 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=60>         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></P>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=60>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../Articles.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to Articles</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../thermal.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Back                  to Thermals</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
