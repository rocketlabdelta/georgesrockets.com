The Cuda Flap model was flown at         the January launch on staged C6's, to see how well it worked         out. It was OK, at least C6's are available, but Aerotech         may be making the R/C reloads again this year.</P>                  <P>To use the Gearcam aboard the Cuda-Flap model, a special         mount assembly was made out of 1/32" plywood. It was made to         mount the camera looking "up" as seen in glide. A pivoting         mirror set up above the lens at nearly 45 degrees to look to         the back for boost, and then rotate to nearly 45 degrees         forward for glide (Biased to look a bit down). The assembly         was made to be temporarily attached to the glider by using         vinyl tape at front and the wing bolt at the rear.</P>                  <P>The Cuda fuselage was modified a bit to allow for a short         pushrod to extend a bit out of the side of the fuselage, so         it would retract when the flap was briefly deployed. When it         retracted, it would release a thread that holds the mirror         looking to the rear, allowing a rubber band to flip the         mirror to the front.</P>                  <P>I had wanted to use the 9 volt battery to power both the         camera and the R/C gear (by using a 7805 regulator). But it         turned out that when sharing the same power source, the         camera picture was affected very badly any time a servo was         moved. So, the model had to fly using its normal 50 mAh         Nicad pack for R/c, plus the 9v battery externally.</P>                  <P>The battery was 37 grams, camera mount/mirror/wiring         assembly 15 grams, and the camera 10 grams. So, 62 more         grams for a model that has a 204 gram glide weight with a         burned out E6 reload in it (266 gram glide weight with the         Gearcam stuff aboard).</P>                  <P>At the launch, Ron Witherspoon manned my high-gain 14db         receiver antenna assembly for some of the flights. Steward         Jones used his own Gearcam receiving equipment, hi-gain         antenna, and digital video camera to record some of my         Gearcam flights, for others he used his digital video camera         to get ground-based footage of the flights. Steward &amp; I         made our own versions of hi-gain antenna pointers using 1/2"         PVC pipe and PVC fittings, as seen below.         <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Feb05/Video-receivers-P1010043.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="Feb05/Video-receivers-P1010043-tb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=87 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD>                  <CENTER><A HREF="Feb05/P1010049.jpg"><IMG SRC="Feb05/P1010049-tb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=101 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         </P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER><A HREF="Feb05/Cuda-Flap.jpg"><IMG SRC="Feb05/Cuda-Flap-tb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=249 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;<BR>         <A HREF="../../GLIDERS/CUDA/CudaFlap.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1">Cuda-Flap         model</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"> as-built in         2001</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P><B>Flight #1</B> was made on staged C6's, with the tower         set to 45 degrees (the Cuda-Flap model does not pitch down         at liftoff, actually tends to pitch up a bit). It yawed a         little bit as it left the tower but otherwise was a good         boost that did not require much correction. But it was         somewhat underpowered with the 62 extra grams aboard,         compared to the non-camera staged C6 flights in January. In         transitioning to glide, the elevator trim was off as the         model was nose-heavy. I briefly lowered the flap and then         adjusted the elevator trim. But it turned out I didn't move         the flap far enough to trigger the mirror to flip, so it had         a tail view all the way. As it turned out, that was a good         thing. It was more interesting to see the V-tail control         surface movement during glide than I thought it would be, so         on that flight the failure to flip the mirror wasn't a bug,         it was a feature.</P>                  <P>I was surprised to see how much the inverted V tail         rocked in flight, during the boosts of all the flights and         even during the glide all the way down on that first flight.         Don't know how much of that to attribute to the graphite         tailboom twisting and how much to the 1/8" balsa tail         surfaces (The tailboom was not the stock Cuda tailboom, it         was a lighter spiral-wrapped one). If I put the Gearcam         aboard a Stingray, just mount it to look to the rear the         whole flight, it might be possible to determine since the         Stingrays have the same boom but their composite tails are         very stiff structurally and some are attached to the boom in         a more direct manner. Also, my Big Bird-3 model suffered         some obvious tail flutter on boost in 2003 when it was flown         in F Dual Eggloft on two C6's and an E9, with an air-started         E9. I might want to put the Gearcam aboard that once, on a         gentler G12 (or F13) boost, to document that before I do the         planned rebuilding of the tail (would be nice to see how         much of that is flexing of the tail and how much is the         tailboom twisting/bending).</P>                  <P>I had suspected that the staged C6's might be too         marginal to fly it at that weight. Fortunately I had some         24mm RC reloads to use for the rest of the day.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="Feb05/snap_4.jpeg"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><IMG SRC="Feb05/snap_4-tb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></A>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A HREF="Feb05/Cuda_Feb05-1.mov"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Quicktime         Movie</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><BR>         (968k)</B></FONT></P></CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top>         <P><B>Flight #2</B> was on a D7, and some clay was added         underneath the root of the V-tail to move the CG back a bit         (never did get the glide CG right though). The D7 took off         just fine, D7's and E6's have a greater thrust spike than         C6's have. It was a nice boost, just it didn't go as high as         a normal D7 boost would due to the weight and the extra         drag.</P>                  <P>All the reload flights were about 30-40% of the durations         they normally would get on those engines (combination of the         extra weight and the drag of the camera mount/mirror/9v         battery, which reduced the boost altitude and affected the         glide).</P>                  <P>The mirror rotated on that flight.

The mirror method works, but needs some fine         tuning. Actually I'm going to try to work out a method to         rotate the camera 180 degrees and not use a mirror         (Something Steward had suggested but I thought the mirror         would be a better way). That would solve the mirror image         problems that had to be fixed in iMovie, not just left-right         but on boost everything is upside down. Also it can probably         be done by putting the camera into a double ended nose cone         pod assembly so it would have far less drag, just held 2" or         so above the wing by a 1/8" pivot rod or something like         that.</P>                  <P>Weight can be drastically reduced too. I have gotten some         145 mAh Li-Poly cells. Two cells in series produce 7.4         volts. I can use that to power the Gearcam, adding in a 5V         voltage regulator. I can also power the R/C gear on another         2-cell 7.4V pack, using a 5V regulator. The two separate         packs (4 total Li-Poly cells) will weigh about the same as a         50 mAh Nicad pack (not including the 5V regulator mass,         maybe 2 grams per), so the weight added by the 9v battery         will be eliminated. I can remove the flap servo in the         fuselage under the wing, to save some mass and allow room to         move the receiver from the nose to where the flap servo is         currently located. Then add a servo to the nose section,         about an inch or so ahead of the wing (the V-tail servos are         located side by side right ahead of the wing), for a servo         to drive a pushrod to rotate the camera pod assembly 180         degrees. The Li-Poly battery packs would go into the         remaining space in the nose, moved around as needed to         hopefully get the right glide CG without needing to add         tailweight. The model would still weigh more than without         the Gearcam, but not nearly so much extra weight and with a         lot less extra drag. Actually, if all I wanted was to just         get a fixed view of the tail, or view forward, without         changing the view in flight, the weight could be just a few         grams more since the two Li-Poly packs will almost equal the         50 mAh Nicad pack, and removing the flap servo would almost         equal the weight of the Gearcam.</P>      </TD>      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=200>         <CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></CENTER><P><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=73>         <P><A HREF="../../GRP-home.htm"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><IMG SRC="../../graphics/HOME.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=top></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><BR>         <IMG SRC="../../graphics/GRP-Text-b.gif" WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=21 ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=575 HEIGHT=73>         <P ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><A NAME=top></A></FONT>         <FONT FACE="Helvetica"><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE="+4" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B><A NAME=top></A></B></FONT><A HREF="../VideoMain.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>To                  Video</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>                  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Main</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../AirborneVideo.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>To                  Air Video</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../GroundVideo.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>To                  Ground Video</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>               <TD WIDTH="25%">                  <CENTER><A HREF="../OtherVideo.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>To                  Other Video</B></FONT></A></CENTER>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>          </FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD WIDTH="1%" HEIGHT=73>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><CENTER></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
